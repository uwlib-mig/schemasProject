         <para>oseph H. Wohleb practiced independently in Olympia from 1911-1945. He joined his son
            Robert in 1946 to form Wohleb and Wohleb. After the death of Joseph in 1958, Robert carried on
            the business as Wohleb and Associates until 1966.</para>
         <para>This drawing shows a preliminary design of an observation tower and restaurant for the
            1962 Seattle World's Fair Exhibition. Set on the only section of the fair grounds that was not
            owned by the city, the site did not have the height restrictions of other exhibits/pavillions
            at the fair. The lot, 37-by-37 m, was purchased by private investors for $75,000 and is still
            privately owned. Although there is much contention surrounding who came up with the final
            design of the Space Needle, John Graham is widely acknowledged as its architect.</para>
