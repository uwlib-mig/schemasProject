At the second stage there were 500 students, now at 3rd stage with 700 students; 300 boys and 400 girls in the program, the students learn theory one day, practice the next. [...] There are 5 sections; machine shop, machine repair, electrical shop, foundry, and assembly of spray pumps for insecticides. The class schedule turns out to be the national work schedule: 7-11 break 2-5 ...holidays on 10, 20 and 30th of each month. Also the students grow "strategic crops"- sweet potatoes, vegetables, water lilies plus pigs, poultry, cows, ducks, rabbits, rice provided by the state... It is a 6-month study program. He said that half had already gone off to work in factories…” [...] “on our walk to the bldg, ptd out the fish breed pool, papaya trees, then we peek into classroom as teachers...the children look extremely young. they are intense, their concentration extraordinary and they seem nervous in front of foreigners...slogans on the walls say things like: we the communist party are correct and clear-sighted...or, to be determined is to always carry out work very rapidly and by leaps and bounds...we are told students range in age of 12 thru 18...we go into a practice room where youngsters are assembling electrical equipment. [...] mumm sez ‘in europe there are many engineers who can not do this, can not thread wires in a dynamo"...others have taken parts from an old car in need of repair and are fixing...one a 200 kilowatt generator, another a 500 kilowatt generator...after parts are reparied the generators are sent back to coops. only pictures of angkor wat or slogans appear in the rooms. we pass rooms where putting together an amplifier for a sound system in a coop” [end of notes...] </para>
