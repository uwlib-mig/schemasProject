            Special Collections staff from the given caption and from additional sources. In the
            absence of any caption, the Title will be provided by Special Collections staff.</para>
         <para>If the caption provided by the photographer is adequate, place it in the Title field.
            Then, the Notes field should include this phrase: Title taken from photograph.</para>
         <para>If the caption provided by the photographer is inadequate, a created title should be
