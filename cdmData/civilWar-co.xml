      Arthur&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; William Porter I expect will start for your camp tomorrow. We shall
      send some things by him. Mother and the boys have written all the news I suppose so that I
      shall not have much to write. If Adelbert is feeble and unable to do duty, he had better come
      home with William, and stay awhile. If they can spare you, I should like to have you come
      along too. Perhaps you had better not apply for a furlough until after Adelbert gets his, so
      as not to be in his way. If you have drawn your money, you had better send</Transcript>

      It is quite thick, if you are troubled to get it out I think you might put in a little warm
      water and soften it. You had better keep the can to put in Molasses or Milk. Enclosed I send a
      line for Capt Jewett which you can read and show to him if you think best to apply for a
      furlough. You can do as you think best about it. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The can
      of Butter marked Egbert is part of Egbert, Arthur, Adelbert, &amp; Leroy. Mother has sent a
      dressing gown, tick, sheets, shirts, etc. so that if any of you boys are taken sick they will
      be nice for you, but if you don't need them and cant carry them you can send them to the
      hospital. You will find a bottle</Transcript>

      thankful that so few lost their lives in the battle of Prestonbury. It seems almost a
      miracle--and a Providential deliverance. You say some of the boys in that march threw away
      their haversack, canteens, etc. How was it with Arthur, did he lose his baggage at that time?
      I think they ought to have kept their canteens, for they would need water in the battle. I
      think those who were in the fight took a wise course to stand behind the trees as much as
      possible. They found that trees are a better protection than rocks. Have you got an India

      "Bushwhackers". I wish you would write how much your luggage weighs which you have to carry on

      to me and will forward it the first opportunity. Are the soldiers in your reg. generally
      immoral? I hope it is not so, but if it is, I hope and trust you will be able to resist
      temptation and keep yourself free from all vice and immoralities. Do they keep up prayer
      meetings? The musical association had two concerts lately for the benefit of soldiers wives
      and mothers. They took about sixty dollars. We are all as well as usual. "Sid" talks a good,
      deal. We have quite a mild winter. I must close, take good care of your health, and be a good

      have you wear them instead of the ones you took as those are mostly cotton. I suppose you wear

      moments in school, I thought I would spend them in writing to you. We received your letter
      Saturday night. Last night came the best news that ever has come to this town. It was that
      Fort Dolanson was taken by our troops, 15,000 rebels taken prisoners, 10,000 killed and
      wounded and 5,000 escaped. Our loss was very bad and severe. It was taken by Gen Grant's
      expedition.</Transcript>

      night that Bowling Green was evacuated and Savana [sic] taken and battle in misouray [sic] and
      Mansaa. Compuntson (?) was evacuated. Old Doctor Smith was excited last night. He would holler
      and talk. He said one or two more battles would whip the South. Father and Dewey want to
      Harrisville to see Lumis and to buy some sheep. He went yesterday morning and has not got back
      yet. That old mink I have not yet catched yet, but I trap for him yet. The Mite Society is up
      to Mr. Russell's this week. That picture that I drawed is not worth seeing, because I did not
      have much time to paint it.</Transcript>

      Charley is marking on his slate and Jim is a ciphering. Hubert's grand-mother, Miss Potter is
      pretty sick with the typhoid fever. Doc has to walk with crutches now. He is getting along
      pretty well. Is Adelbert well so that he can do duty? Bill Powers went up to Medina to carry
      up the news of the taking of the fort. George Hay comes to our Sunday School now all the time.
      Ely Coder came here last Saturday and went home Sunday afternoon. Today it is just like
      spring. As Quincy is going to write the next page, I will close. Write soon,

    <Transcript>Seville Feb.18-1862 &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Friend Arthur. As Whit said
      that I might write a line on the last page, I thought it was a good opportunity to write to
      you. Are you all well in camp now? Has Egg received my letter that I wrote to him? The old
      cannon roared last night for the victory that our troops achieved under Genl. Grant, commander
      of land forces, and Commodore Foot of Flotica (?). The gun boats had to leave for being
      disabled. One boat received 57 shots; another 27. Our troops suffered severely. The rebels
      loss was 10,000 killed and wounded and 15,000 prisoners. That is pretty good news for us.
      Bowling Green has been evacuated by the rebels, and Michel has taken possession of it, but I
      must close for want of room. The Mite Society is to be held this week at the home of Mr.
      Russell.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; From Q.L. DOWD.</Transcript>

      home from the meeting house and have not anything to do, I thought I would write to you. Uncle
      John or William Porter is coming down there next month some time, perhaps. It has been pretty
      cold weather this week, but today it is thawing. The chores that I have to do is to milk the
      cow, throw down the hay for the horse and cow at night, chop wood, fetch in half the wood and
      Tim the other, and other trifling chores, too numerous to mention. There was a</Transcript>

      read off the cards of misbehavior and good behavior. Bill Powers was the worst of all of them.
      It was 15 good and 75 bad. When he read it all the folks in the house laughed like everything.
      Mother has baked lots of ginger snaps and so has Miss Dowd for to send down to where your are.
      I keep my gun loaded in the house. Mornings when it is pleasant, I take my gun and go up the

      his letter? He wrote one to you. Mrs. Flood when she comes down here to wash she talks about
      you. She says it is to bad to have such little boys go to war, that battle that I promised to
      send you ain't made yet, so I won't send it. Uncle John feels pretty bad about Adelbert being
      sick. Give my love to all the boys and tell them to write to me and I will write to them. We
      are all well, but Cidney has got a little cold. He goes out to the barn with me to do the
      chores and he fetches in wood.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Write soon.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>&amp; the other on Saturday evening. The first given by the Baptist choir &amp;
      others, under Mr. Whitney's supervision for the purpose of raising means to buy an Instrument
      for the Church. The other, given by the Musical Association under Mr. H.E. Matterson's
      direction, for the "Aid of Needy Wives &amp; Mothers of our Volunteers". I am one of the
      performers in the last mentioned concern. Our music consists of the Old folks style &amp; the
      Modern. We shall all wear the ancient costume &amp; look as ridiculous as one can I
      presume.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Last evening we met at Mr. Will Porters in the capacity of a Mite
      Society concerning which gathering you may have a small remembrance stored away in your memory
      too, perhaps. Very pleasant time &amp; lot of fun &amp; cider. Next time you write me, I want
      you should scour the bottom of your tin cup until you can see your own eyes in it, so that you
      can tell one their color. Mademoiselle Mary &amp; I had a fierce combat on that subject one
      day &amp; we at least concluded to refer the matter to you for settlement. Tell Herb I want he
      should write me another "all night" letter if he can get time. I wrote him some three weeks
      ago. I should think I inclosed [sic] in his letter a small one for you. Did you get in his
      letter a small one for you. Did you get it? It was addressed to Louiser Ky. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Now I must say goodby and God bless &amp; keep you.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; With

    <Transcript>to do you have done it with a will &amp; that my knowledge makes us very anxious to
      hear from you personally. Twice have I written you since receiving letters from you, &amp;
      from what I can learn, you have not yet received any letters from home, since leaving
      Columbus. This is sad. Still I firmly believe you will get them some time, &amp; though they
      may be somewhat stale, you will no doubt experience some little pleasure in reading them
      finally.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Do you know that this is one of the mornings when all treedom has
      on a complete suit of icy armour; every individual branchlet &amp; twiglet glitters with a
      pendant jewel. If old Soll should only condescend to open a few of his bright beams upon them,
      what an envious state of scintillation there would be going on, in these old cherry trees in
      front of my window. Boreas has already turned them up to such a pitch, that they are snapping
      furiously to the tune of C sharp &amp; surely if they continue their wild dance long, they
      will B flat &amp;</Transcript>

      there &amp; think it quite likely his regiment is there or near there. How do you like those
      wild hills? The mountains are not far south of you, in the same county I believe. I wonder if
      the cold winds whistle merry music in your hearing some of these nights when you are on
      guard?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Ah! Here comes a call. I must go &amp; cut out work for the Aid
      Society for the rest of this day. So goodby my dear boy. I shall hope for &amp; more than half

    <Transcript>request on my last attempt at writing. Certain it is. I was not disappointed last
      Saturday night. When I got home from singing school, I found the coveted letter. You may be
      assured the news it contained was very eagerly read and reread. Even now, it hardly seems
      possible that you boys have really been so near a live battle. Not only so near, but preserved
      unhurt. You cannot tell how fervent and earnestly grateful were and are the prayers offered by
      those who always pray for you and many others who never prayed for you before. You may easily
      imagine that we all rejoice with you in the victory you have won so bravely. That you may be
      equally successful in every engagement into which you may be called in the future, is the very
      earnest desire of every earnest heart. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; We hear tonight of another battle in
      Kentucky in which we presume your regiment had no part and yet the rebels are said to have
      retreated leaving much of their baggage and their dead upon the field. Did you not experience
      some sensations that were decidedly new, that day when you wandered over the field in search
      of dead men! You did not then cheer over your foe, but buried them decently and properly I
      trust. It does indeed seem that the Lord was on our side and that victory was in his hand. You
      did not mention the name of the comrade that died of his wounds. Was he one whom any of us
      knew?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; How do you endure those long fatigueing marches, with sometimes but
      little sleep &amp; but little to eat, for we know though you don't say anything of it, that
      you are sometimes hard up in that particular.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I can readily understand that you all think as we can not help you out of such
      calamities, if indeed you do have them. It is of no use to tell us about them, as I suppose
      you think we as your friends might worry uselessly &amp; sometimes unnecessarily, &amp; in
      this, perhaps you do wisely though I must confess to a strong desire to know all about you as
      you move along, for it is a fact that we could sometimes eat our never failing supper with a
      clearer conscience if we knew of a certainty that "our boys" were not obliged to seek a hard
      pillow with empty stomachs. You need not tell me anything about the hardships (if you meet any
      such) unless you wish but I want you to understand that I want to know just as much of your
      circumstances &amp; condition as you feel inclined to tell me; not only on account of my warm
      interest in your welfare, but as matters of history. How does Sir Herbert flourish, I suppose
      you are all trying to "endure hardships as good soldiers".</Transcript>

    <Transcript>This is all right. Does your armour ever get misplaced. Your Christian armor, I
      mean. Do you ever feel any of the hinges grating harshly? I often think that in the absence of
      a Sabbath among you (for I should judge the Sabbath to be merely a seventh day among soldiers
      generally) far from the gentle, loving influence of Mother Sister friends. The heart &amp;
      souls of men &amp; boys must, to some extent at least, grow hard &amp; selfish, unless there
      is within a wellspring of purity &amp; goodness that will gush out continually always seeking
      a chance to cheer, encourage &amp; strengthen somebody. And it is a fact that sometimes, even
      where there is really a spring fresh &amp; pure, that the channel in which it is wont to flow
      out will get clogged up &amp; cause the sweet silver spirit to lie still until it becomes
      stagnant, unless it has strength from the parent source &amp; thus flow on with increased
      power sweeping before it, or rushing boldly over all obstacles that may seem to
      hinder.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>My dear boy, will you allow me to talk right to your heart a little bit. I cannot
      endure the thought that by any outside influence, or any failure of energetic exercise of
      feeling on your own part, your own bright shining spirit should become dim &amp; lusterless.
      The constant prayer of my heart to our elder brother is for your return with the same pure,
      earnest, truthful expression of integrity &amp; peace written upon your face &amp; evident in
      all your motions, &amp; in order to this, your life must be stainless in the meantime. How is
      it as night after night passes you &amp; no Mothers kiss &amp; loving goodnight meets your lip
      &amp; eye no little prattling baby brothers with laughing eyes &amp; loving motions to provoke
      a hug or frolic out of pure good nature; does the want of these little family delights have
      the effect to dry up the fountain of human sweetness in your heart?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; O, my
      Arthur, let the memory of those things which make life bright &amp; sunny dwell in your mind
      &amp; keep it fresh &amp; pure, while</Transcript>

    <Transcript>the harsher parts of your character are being developed by your present manner of
      life. Do not allow yourself to become reckless &amp; don't care for anything. When weary,
      footsore, hungry &amp; dispirited, you must seek your hard pillow without a single word of
      cheer, comfort, or soothing from any loved &amp; loving one of the home friends. Even in the
      absence of all these tender &amp; precious blessings, so little thought of &amp; cared for,
      when they are at hand &amp; can be had without the asking, so inestimably precious when longed
      for, &amp; not to be had, even in the absence of these things, I say, keep good courage bright
      &amp; allow the sweet angel of hope to whisper the loving &amp; comforting words, you may not
      hear from other lips. You are none of you forgotten by any one, or at any time: whenever we
      meet the "boys" &amp; the latest news from them, is always the subject of talk. You forget to
      tell me whether Delbert was dead or alive: but from Herbs letter we learned that he was better
      &amp; would soon be out. I read a letter from one of the 2d Ohio Cavalry boys last night. They
      were at Illinois town on the O &amp; M R.R. for a night on their way to Kansas (Leavenworth
      City) via St. Louis. The letter was discriptive [sic] of their journey so far, chiefly. No
      particular news. The prevailing anxiety being to get into "Seceohdon" &amp; get to work as
      soon as possible. It is quite probable too, that under Jim Lanes command they will be put to
      actual service before long. I also read a letter from a young fellow who seems to be in
      Virginia somewhere. He spoke of having been in a skirmish on the west bank of the Potomac in
      which the rebels were routed &amp; mostly taken prisoners. He was writing to John Mansfield
      &amp; says "I tell you John, it makes a fellow jump some when one of his mates is shot down by
      his side. One of my mates was shot through the head &amp; as he fell his blood flowed all over
      me! It was enough</Transcript>

      Arthur:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I recd. your letter of the 5th of last month in about two weeks
      after the date and have been as tardy in replying as the mails were in delivering. You know I
      am not much of a letter writer and it is quite a task for me to commence. I do not think I
      have written 3 letters in one year. You will excuse me for the delay if I will promise to do
      better in future. I don't know as I will be able to interest you in anything that I may write
      but will do the best I can so here is at it.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I suppose the letters you receive from home keep you pretty well posted in regard to
      things in Seville. We have quite a mild winter so far snow not to exceed 3 inches at one time.
      The roads have been very good for the last six weeks, no mud of which the soldiers complain of
      so much. I tell you there is quite an interest here in the 42nd Reg. Every letter that comes
      from any of you has to be read loud so that all may hear from their friends who are with you.
      I suppose you have experienced some of a soldiers life ere this and there is one good thing
      you do not complain of your lot that shows pluck in you instead of that whining dissatisfied
      mood that</Transcript>

      I hope you will continue so to do till the end which may not be as soon as was expected last
      fall owing to as it seems to us inactivity in some of the divisions of the army. If they would
      all press forward as your column did it seems as though this thing might be put down in three
      or four months but we do not see all the difficulties that present themselves to an advancing
      army. I hope something may take place so that we will see you all home to spend the fourth of
      July with us and by the way the guns that you used last 4th are in the counting room as you
      left them</Transcript>

      a different kind of muster the cadets with, wont you. That specimen you sent from camp Chase
      to you [sic] mother is hanging by the show case and is the subject of many inquires. Some
      think it is one thing and some another when told what it is and that it is the production of a
      [?] prisoner they say that he was a yankee or the son of a yankee at best. I think he had
      perfect control of his knife perhaps better than of his brain for he had [?] whittling than
      rebelling. The war news has its ups &amp; downs. One day we think when is something going to

    <Transcript>Last nights news was a little exciting and good if true. You know it wants
      confirming two or three times before it is worthy of belief. It seems our armies have had one
      more victory and planted our flag on the soil of rebellious Tennessee fort Henry captured 2
      generals one colonel and fifty privates captured by our fleet. Our loss is larger than the
      Confederates which is about 35. It seems that Romney is occupied by our troops again and some
      other indications that goes to show that there will be something done as soon as the roads get
      so an army can move. This all quite on the Potomac I don't like but there is a</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Monday evening, Feb 17th, 62&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dear
      Arthur,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Your letters of Feb 5th &amp; 9th were received by us Saturday
      evening, and I need not tell you how glad we all were to hear from you, I had expected to have
      written last evening, but Major Pardee sent us word about dark last night that he started this
      morning, for Kentucky, and would take anything to our boys that we wished to send. On so short
      notice, we had not much to send. I sent you one pair of socks, which Mother knit for her
      Soldier boy, may he live to need more. Some papers &amp; paper &amp; Charlie's letter. We sent
      word to Herberts mother but she was not at home. She had gone down to care for her Mother who
      is quite sick with Typhoid fever. You may let George Porter know about it, if he has not heard
      from&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; [Written on side of page]: I have been writing in my
      bedroom, seated by our little stove. Whitney executes his drawings here, and writes his
      letters, there is room for Arthur were he here.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; [Written
      upside down above greeting]: If the things that I send you will be of no use to you, they can
      be sent to the nearest hospital, but hope if any of you need them, you can have them to use.
      Give my love to all of the boys and beleive [sic] me as ever. Your affectionate Mother R.M.
      Strong.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>home before you receive this.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; This
      evening&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; paper brings news of your advance to Piketon, nearer the enemy but
      farther from home, but may the same protecting care shield you from danger &amp; death. We
      hear that the Typhoid fever is amoung [sic] you. You cannot be to careful about keeping
      yourself dry, as exposure to damp &amp; wet cloths is one cause of the disease, Arthur if at
      any time you have the care of the sick be very careful that you get fresh air &amp; not stand
      or sit betwen [sic] a sick person and the draught of air, such as an open door or window or
      even the fire, and do not wait upon the sick, with an empty stomache. If you should be with
      Typhoid fever, try and get where it will be as quiet as possible and trust more (under
      providence) to pure air, and being washed with tepid casteel soap suds three or four times a
      day and rubed [sic] dry, than any medicin [sic]. I hope that Aalbert is well by this
      time&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; [Written on side of page]: Eli Kender [?] was here
      yesterday, he sends love to you. Robbert has written to you.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>which you are subjected have a tendency to make prize home and its influences less.
      Be very careful in forming habits of thought or deed that you would feel were improper at
      home, for you have many friends that daily pray for you and expect much of you. If your life
      is spared, disappoint not their hopes. Return to us Arthur as you left, free from the many
      vices that may surround you. It is quite late, must close for tonight, so good-bye for
      tonight.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Almost a week has past and my letter has not
      gone, so I will try and finish it tonight. It has been a very sad day in town, one of our best
      women has been conveyed to that home from which no traveler returns. Mrs. Porter, Herberts
      dear GrandMother has gone to her home in heaven. You boys have lost a very dear friend. At Aid
      society, she took a great deal of interest, as in everything that was for the good of mankind.
      But she has gone to her reward. May we all follow her example. You must try and comfort George
      to see the necessity of being at all times prepared for death, in order for this, we must so
      live that death will not be a terror to us. May we all so live that if we are called in the
      first second or third watch, we shall be found ready and
      waiting.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Uncle John feels so anxious about Adelbert that
      he may be the bearer of this letter. If he should not, you must not let Adelbert stay if it
      can be helped. Till he is not able to come home, for his father would near get over
      reproaching himself if A should never see home again, but I hope that he is decidedly better.
      You must let us know the worst when you write again.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      [Written on left side of page, continued along top of page in faint ink and halfway down the
      right side of the page, then written upside down from the center of the page to the end]:
      Arthur, if Uncle John does not call on you, we shall send some things direct to you. You must
      take good care of the, the provisions will be marked. You must let Dell have his share and the
      biscuit you can keep for sickness. The other things you can divide as you please. The clothing
      that I send to your special care as I made it. I thought if you stopped any time in one place,
      you might find them very useful. If any of you are not well, fill your tick with some straw,
      have some sheets and a pillow and a clean quilt and a dressing gown to put on, it would seem
      quite homelike. Take good care of them and when not in use, have them put away in a safe place
      and when you move have them in a box, so that they may be sent with the
      baggage.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; From your mother.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Mr. President: It is natural for man when trying to bring his thoughts together that
      different subjects present themselves for his consideration. Therefore what few feeble remarks
      we may attempt to make will be of that character. Men sometimes think that after once trying
      to arrive at a certain point and fail that it is of no use to try again. To such persons we
      would seek the concilliating words of the poet. If you do not at first succeed try, try again,
      time will bring you to reward, try, try again. On the other hand. we like to see the mechanic
      pursuing his daily avocation, the farmer at his plow, the merchant behind his counter, and the
      school boy in school trying to obtain an education. We like to see all this, but more than
      this we like to see the little Dog and pat him on his head. How prettily he wags his tail when
      he is fed. What will become of that other class a hundred years to come; we all within are
      graves shall sleep, a hundred years to come; No living soul for us will weep, A hundred years
      to come; But other men our lands will till, And others then our streets will fill, While other
      birds will sing as gay, And bright the sun shine, as to-day.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; A hundred years
      to come.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>When we walk out on a bright winter eavning [sic], and behold the snow the
      unconstant moon that monthly changes in her circle orb, and now and then the twinkling of
      myriad of stares, we as led to exclame [sic] in the language of the poet with a sonorous voice
      (again) Twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are? Up above the world so high like
      a Diamond in the sky. And finaly [sic] there is a class of persons who believe that secession
      is right and as a bout seceding from this union (and we are afraid they will be the ruin of
      it). To such persons we will repeat the language of an old solger [sic] of the revolution. Do
      thay talk of dissolving the union. Ah; well may your cheek grow pale, and well may an old man
      tremble and his heart beat faint and low, when he think of the price it cost us some fourscour
      [sic] years ago. I have wached [sic] its growing greatness through a life of many tears, and I
      never forgot it was purchased with blood and tears; I never forgot the privations of fourscour
      [sic] years ago when the naked feet of our poor recruits left crimson tracks in the snow. And
      if I eaver [sic] this constellation shall be marred as rent in twain it would blast the sight
      of these poor old eyes to see its folds</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Camp near Youngs Point, April 6th 1863&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Ma,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; What have I done that I should be altogether forgotton from nearly all
      parts of Ills. but nothing for me from you. One letter I received from a post office close by
      you mailed on the 27 of March. Which proves that you could not have written up to that date
      since March 7th for had you written to me, yours would reach me as well as others. Now I do
      seariously [sic] think your course both unkind and cruel; and wanting even in a sisters
      regard, leaving the wife out of the question. You may think it all right, and may mean and
      intend to do right. But I tell you your course, and conduct is both cruel and wicked. I do
      every thing I know how to, that you and the children may be comfortable and happy. But you
      treat me not even as your servant, but as your dog; to shirk for myself. Really if this utter
      neglect of writing is continued by you, any excuse you may offer will be an insult. For where
      you cannot write, the children can; and if they cannot, some of the neighbors can, even though
      you were all sick. If there was a will, or a desire to write to me upon your part it would not
      be as it is. Today while wading out of our overflowed camp up to our chins [shins] in water, I
      thought if I only got a letter with todays mail from you, it would compensate for all
      exposure, and privation. And when</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I opened the mail and found no letter for me from home among the hundreds handled, I
      felt as I hope I may never feel again.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; When I think Jane all I do for you
      and how little you care about it or appreciate it, I become almost wild with grief. I lay
      whole nights and weep over your cold and heartless treatment. Any woman almost would treat me
      kindly to my face, and there like you, when absent forget and neglect.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Recently I made about $30 clear of my salary and immediately invested it in something for you,
      which with care would last your lifetime and childrens also. I had no sooner done it than I
      thought as I held it in my hand that I had purchased it for one who could so far forget me
      while yet living, that she could leave off writing. Of course then I'll be forgotton in my
      grave. Well, be it so, said I to myself. Let me be forgotton; but let me not neglect to
      perform and keep my vows. Let me be true if others are false.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; But I stop. I
      had no thought of writing more than two or three lines when I began. I am cold, tired, yes
      worn out; and I am quite sleepy. I will send the box I spoke of in my last, the first
      opportunity. Kiss the children for the absent and
      forgotton,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; S.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Pitsburgh Battle Field, April 20th, 1862&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Mrs. S.
      D. Lougheed,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dearest and best of wives, an exceedingly unpleasant day as was
      yesterday, off the track as Johny says. This has been to me and the day previous. It has
      rained and rained and rained until there was not one dry spot on which to set the sole of our
      foot in our tents or outside. I have recently been appointed Regimental P.M. and I take the
      mail every day to the boat, and carry back whatever there may have been received for the
      Regiment. I like it much. I have a good horse kindly furnished me by the Government as long as
      I may need him. All required of me is to feed him Government furnished food. Day before
      yesterday I rode down with the mail (it is nearly 5 miles) and on my way back, there set in
      one of the heaviest rains I ever remember of experiencing one. My boots rained full of water,
      on the side the storm beat most fiercely. It, the water, was ankle deep to my horse on the
      level. It rained so tremendously that the water had not time to run off. Well, it rained on
      until I reached camp, drenched through and through. What made things much worse my bed, made
      entirely of hay was wet as water; ground wet, blanket wet, and tent leaking like a riddle.
      Poor prospect for sleeping this night, said I to one of our boys who was in my tent. Well, it
      was the case with every tent in camp. I need not tell you my dear, I wished to be home long
      enough to get warm, and change wet for dry clothing. What made matters much worse, I had early
      in the morning gone to the brook and washed one pair of drawers, on flannel shirt and one
      white shirt, one pocket handkerchief, two towels, and some other things, and all were hanging
      up in</Transcript>

    <Transcript>my tent not yet dry. Fortunately however, as you will remember, I brought my summer
      suit along, and as the morning had been intensely warm, I had put them on to carry my mail,
      and had crowded my dress parade suit in my valice [sic], a thing I never thought of doing
      before. And that which I had in my valice [sic] was all I had dry in the state of Tennessee.
      Night came on cold or should say chilly and I sat up as long as I could keep awake: And I then
      lay down wrapt [sic] up in my blanket, and rubber coat, but I could not sleep, neither could I
      get warm. Two other boys who write or clerk it at Head Quarters, could lay and sleep away, and
      it raining on them all the time, But I could not, and will not, when I can help it. So I got
      up and succeeded in building a fire and put on my rubber coat and stoodover it until morning
      in the rain. I thought a few times of Home ... Well, next day not very well. Pain in head side
      and bowels. Fixed up my bed of hay (my Saviour had such a bed in Bethlehem) and I lay down and
      fell asleep. But still it rained, and rained. Before night I took off my shoes and stockings
      and almost baked my feet before the fire. Felt better and slept better during the night. But
      still it rained this morning we had a slight sprinkle of hail or snow, but it did not last
      long. I wonder how all are doing at home. I hope the weather is not so unpleasant there. I do
      not think it would be well for me to spend many days and nights like some few in the past, if
      I want to live long. But I will do the best I</Transcript>

      I have just eaten for my supper three of Susans biscuit, the last of them too; I had hid them
      in my valice [sic]. I tell you what as Willie says, they were a treat. They had not a single
      thing to eat at Head Quarters to-day at dinnertime. I don't understand how it is. But you can
      explain it my dear better than I, when I have told you they trust to the "Darkey". I never
      said one word to Col. nor Adjutant, but let it pass along until Supper. When I stumbled
      accidentally on Susans 3 cakes, and they will answer me till morning. How the balance got
      along I know not. In the morning I think of breakfasting with some one of the companies. It is
      now raining again quite hard. I hope &amp; pray it will clear off soon. But the Lord knows
      what is best for us. He sends the rain. Well we are here in Camp an immense host. Between 1
      &amp; 200,000. When we are to make an advance know one save the Commanding Genl knows.
      Probably within the next ten days, we will move on some point of the enemies country, and with
      the blessing of God, strike one more blow on the head of rebellion. And may the God of battles
      make it effectual, and the last. I would like to give you many very many more particulars of
      the late &amp; great battle; but I fear it would awaken feelings, and emotions, apart from
      pleasure in your mind. I will only mention two or three incidents which will enable you to
      form some idea of the terrible destruction of human life on both sides. In some graves we
      burried [sic] as many as 40 of our own soldiers, side by side, and one on top of the other. In
      others, we buried [sic]</Transcript>

    <Transcript>of the rebel soldiers killed in battle as high as 140 in one grave and some pits may
      have had more in than that. From this one fact you can infer how much more numerous their
      rebel dead were than that on our side. O is it not shocking to think of? This morning I saw a
      Lieutenant who had been killed in battle, and had been buried [sic] without a coffin,
      disinterred. His people having sent a metallic coffin for the body. I sat on my horse and
      looked at the body for some time; but I will not describe it. I thought of our loved and long
      lost dead, who sleep on still in the undisturbed repose of the grave, far far away from this
      bloody battle field. Peaceful be their slumbers, and God grant that we may meet them all in
      the skies. How pleasant to run backward over the pathway of human life to the home of
      childhood, the parental roof, the loved, and loving, who gathered around the social hearth.
      When we wandered by the quiet brook, winding through the meadow in company with those whose
      presence gave a charm to life; but whose voice of silvery sweetness has long since been hushed
      in death. I have said it is pleasant; but we cannot tarry long in the background. The unbidden
      tear of affection, and sorrow steals down the chute; and were we to tarry long there,
      ruminating and grieving for those once linked to our own existence, but from whom we have been
      separated by a stroke of the unwelcome messenger "death", we would be unfitted for the duties
      of life.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I trust my dear you have been prudent, and that
      both yourself and that little darling son and my blackeyed Posey Girl and lovely Bettie, and
      sprightly Annie, and Energetic Johny, and manly Willie are all doing well. I trust Mr. Finley;
      and Susan are well also. My kind regards to them. Should you get out of meat buy one more ham
      of Mr. Jackson until I make you a remittance. The Paymaster has not yet arrived. We look for
      him daily. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Yours in purest affection,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;

    <Transcript>Vicksburg, Miss. July 12th 1863 &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My own Dear
      Jennie,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I wrote you a few lines yesterday with my pencil. Today having more
      time I concluded to write again. The troops have had a fight with Rebel Genl Johnson and gave
      him a severe thrashing, taking several hundred prisoners. Genl Osterhouse of our army was
      killed. It would be more proper to say that he was murdered. It appears that Genl Osterhouse
      and his Brigade had been taken prisoners by the rebels near Jackson. They had scarcely taken
      him when Genl Sherman with the balance of his troops surrounded the rebs &amp; retook all of
      the Brigade of Genl Osterhouse. The rebs seeing they must give up their prisoners,
      deliberately shot Genl Osterhouse, striking him also with the but [sic]or breech of their
      guns. This conduct dont compare very well with</Transcript>

      after the fall of Vicksburg. Very probably they will have to account for it yet. Such conduct
      even in war deserves to be severely dealt with.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I expect
      our Regiment is now in Jackson. They will be back again however soon. I understand Genl Grant
      intends to have all his men go into camps in the vicinity of Vicksburg until the hot weather
      has subsided. Several times I have been all ready to go on to the Regiment, but then each and
      every day turns out to be so very hot, that I have not dared undertake it. The heat is most
      intense here now and will be getting worse for all July August and September. There are quite
      a number getting sick and I have my fears, up until after September.</Transcript>

      it be otherwise? To whom shall I go for counsel? On whom shall I rely for advice, if I am not

      thee, alone. Only to thee, True, fond, ever to thee, my own precious Jennie. Thou art my
      adviser, my nearest and dearest friend, on Earth or in heaven, next to my blessed Lord and
      saviour. To be absent from thee dear one much longer is becoming to painful for endurance. And
      unless my heavenly father orders otherwise I will spend but one month more in the army. After
      the 15th of next month you need not write any more as I will not get your letters. Not but
      what I would be most happy to get them. They are the only letters that do me any good. I find

      night and is 50 miles from "Pitsburgh Landing" 10 miles from "Grand Junction", and 50 miles
      from Memphis. We left "Chawalla" 3 days ago and have been marching through intense heat and a
      perfect cloud of dust. Sometimes I could not see the 5th man in front of me for the dust. Our
      troops and transportation wagons reach for nearly 10 miles along the road. And understand ours
      is only 1 Division of the army. Our route has been mostly through a wooded country with here
      and there a Log House, and a few acres of improved land. I think the women and men thus far
      are very uninteresting. No danger of any of our men falling in love with any of the southern
      Ladies we have seen yet: we may however find some better looking. At "Big Muddy" a small

      but more desolate looking women; there were no men to be seen. Our first night after leaving
      "Big Muddy" we camped in the woods near a large corn and oats field. The corn was large enough
      to tassel out, and the oats fit to cut. I cradled some of them for my horse. There was very
      little oats or corn left by morning. We got off again at an early hour and marched until 5

    <Transcript>in the evening; at which time we reached this camp. We have delightful water here,
      and plenty of it, for man and beast. I washed me in the large stream of water which flows
      between two lofty ridges, which are adorned with the tall majestic pine trees, and also the
      Chestnut. I have seen whole forests of pine, most of the trees standing over 100 feet high,
      and from 1 to 2 feet in diameter. The chestnut are very abundant. We find many delightful
      springs of clear cold water, where I take much pleasure in washing off the dust gathered
      during the day, and then lie down on the ground with my blankets (which I carry behind my
      saddle) over &amp; under me and sleep very sweetly, simply because sleep is a necessity. What
      the people have been doing in this country for so many years I cannot tell. Certainly they are
      100 years behind the times. It really seems to me I have done as much this spring on our own

    <Transcript>1 O clock Tuesday Morning Oct 7th 1862&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Mrs. S D
      Lougheed&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My adorable Jane&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I seize my pen though at an
      unseasonable hour to ebrace [sic] thee my Love, before I lay my weary head to rest. You may
      wonder that I am sitting up when the hour of 11-12 and 1 have struck for the night. But it is
      then dearest you seem nearest me, and my spirit inn ecstacies [sic] of delight rejoices in
      imagining [sic] itself in converse with the best of wives. But O how I long to embrace you. I
      have been busily engaged when in my tent reading the battles of Joshua and those of
      "Bonaparte". I have been much interested and I trust benefited. We have one poor boy I think
      will die before morning in Hospital: he has consumption. I hope he is prepared. How are my
      darling children? I often sigh when I think of my children forgetting me being away so much
      from their fond society. But I am still more concerned about their education. O how unhappy I
      felt when I think of falling in battle, and leaving you dearest to struggle alone with six
      children through an almost friendless world. Long since I fully made up my mind to one thing,
      and that is this. You and I have to work our passages through this world unassisted by friends
      or relatives. They will accept any help from me, but afford me nor mine no help. But we must
      not distrust providence. Our hope is in him. Our day was clouded for some time. Now I trust it
      has cleared up, the clouds have broken, and the sun of prosperity, at least in a measure is
      dawning upon us. We must and will be thankful. Tell Willie to hear Bettie read 3 or 4 times
      each day. But I must close. I write in great haste. Accept an affectionate embrace, and
      believe me only and forever yours&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Samuel.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; P.S. The prospect darkens concerning my visit
      home. I'm quite sure now I will not get started before the middle of November. The paymaster
      should he come now could hardly get our Division paid before that time. And it may be that
      they will put off paying us</Transcript>

    <Transcript>till January 1863. But I hardly think they will do so. But dearest, do, please write
      your name on a piece of paper and send it to me at least twice each week. It will soon be two
      weeks since I heard fro home. A heart that fondly loves feels keenly the
      neglect.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Adieu, Dear Love.
      S.D.L.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Tuesday morning. My Dearest and adorable Jane. Day
      as lovely as ever broke on the world has returned. The sun is climbing the steep of heaven.
      The morning is lovely beyond description. The fresh breeze fans my cheek as I sit beneath the
      shadow of a majestic oak, and seize my pen to improve a few leisure moments in communicating a
      few lines more to my noble my darling wife. My poor sick boy still lives. He is quite young.
      Never was taught to read. He asked me to go home with him. I should have gone with him but he
      was too feable [sic] to travil [sic]. Lives near the banks of the Mississippi 40 miles above
      Cairo. He spoke of his mother, an only sister, and thought if they were only near him to
      nurse, and prepare his food he would feel so much better. But it has been otherwise ordered.
      Poor boy, I made his case my own. How sad I should feel to die, without my Angel wife to go
      with me and stand close by my side at least to the ford of Jordan. Then if heaven called I
      could go, desireing [sic] to lisp in death the dear name of Jesus. Jane, Baby, Josie Bettie
      Andrew Johny Willie. Tis hard to lie down covered with your own gore on a battle field and
      die. Tis hard to see the mighty prancing war horse, trampling the dying and dead beneath their
      merciless feet. No dear wife, near to speak a word of comfort. No living sister or Mother to
      administer relief in that hour the most sad in the history of humanity. O the humanity. O the
      horrors of war. Truly it may be considered the most cruel and awful scourge which can befall a
      nation. Heaven grant there may be an end soon. The mail closes very shortly and I stop. I can
      only send Kisses and an affectionate embrace. Beneath and around thee are the everlasting
      arms. Yours only and forever adored one,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Samuel.</Transcript>

      Lougheed&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My Dear Precious Wife,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; For one
      week or more I have felt sad and sick. Sad, because I could not hear from you: day after day
      passed and nothing, no nothing could I hear. Well my sadness broke away today like the storm
      cloud in a summer sky when god throws the rainbow over it. Just so with your letter. Had it
      been your own sweet self, whispering words of gentleness and kindness upon my spirit, the
      dispeling [sic] of the cloud of gloom which hung over my mind, could not have been more
      apparent.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I have written you twice of late, both letters
      only a few days apart, and I fear they will make you feel badly. You will my dear understand
      how they came to be written. I was sick, and besides, felt just as you say in your kind letter
      "that you were slow in answering my letters." Yes, very slow, and too slow. It is too much
      perhaps to add, cruelly "slow." Place yourself where</Transcript>

      suitable companions for you any where, and you expecting to hear from me and the children
      every day, and every day, and nothing come, would you not think strangely of my conduct? Would
      you not think my silence cruel? Never since our marriage have I had such occasion to think

      I am myself, once more. One thousand five hundred thanks for you sweet soul cheering letter.
      And as many times do I ask your pardon for any thing I may have written which may have wounded
      your feelings. But O my dear one; no tongue or pen can ever describe how awfully my poor mind
      was tortured. I had suffered so much mental depression that I had almost lost command of
      myself. I had got so I could immagine [sic] any thing about home, and believed all I immagine
      [sic]. This you will perceive at a glance is drifting far down towards the gates of self
      destruction. I tremble now when I think how awfully I have been tempted, just in regard to
      this very thing. And I earnestly beg</Transcript>

    <Transcript>that it may never occur again. You cannot Dear one but know all about me by this
      time. You know that I am so constituted, that I must be all devotion or none at all. Being
      thus constituted some designing Christian rascals have taken advantage of me in days by gone,
      and fairly rob'd me. This has led me to distrust every human being outside of my own dear
      family. And in my own family I must be all devotion. There is no half way, or milk and water
      work about me. I cant love my family a little: if I could, it would be a small matter for a
      silence of three weeks or three months to occur. But with me, as you must bear me witness, my
      regard for my family is a devotion, to them, and for them, all I know, or can show. Is it not
      quite natural then, that a protracted silence should interfere with my comfort of mind? May
      you never dear one feel the pang. May my right hand forget its cunning, when I knowingly
      neglect any duty I owe my family. Even to the neglect to write a letter. Since I read your
      letter I have felt amused at some things it contains. Poor old hog, 14 pigs at one
      time?</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Did you not make a mistake? Well she will need a heap of feed, in order to raise
      such a brood. She may try again, don't you say so? Feed the two sows separate. Have Ed dig you
      out two good feed troughs. You cant do without them. If he cant plow prairie keep him at the
      timber. You will need a good wood pile before cold weather, and bad roads set in. Save every
      stake and pole that will make a rail. Soon as it will answer have him cutting the corn. Are
      the peas gathered in the garden?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I am sorry about Billy.
      Advise with Mr. Jackson what to do for him. If he was put in the stable with Charlie, why
      Charlie will have it and it will almost kill him? Billy ought not to be allowed to run with
      either of the other horses. Special care must be taken of him. Mr. Jackson will tell you what
      to do for the ox. I would not sell the stripper. You will need her for beef. She will be so
      fattened on grass. Maybe she will be a late new milks cow if so we can buy a young beef for
      about $10, and still keep the cow. If she is worth $15, dry she will be worth the same when
      she gives milk and her calf in the spring will be worth 4 or 5 dollars. I am looking you will
      see my dear after the increase of our stock, and the supply of our home market with as little
      outlay as possible. Besides the cow is accustomed to the peace. Still if you can find a fresh
      cow with calf and you are better suited than with our oxen, you have my consent to trade or
      sell and buy but don't pay boot. Though I prefer to increase our stock than diminish it. I
      wish we could buy 10 or 12 calves. Their keeping would cost us but little and they would
      double their money or value by spring. And in the summer they would cost nothing, running on
      the prairie. Think about it and tell me what you think.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>[Written above greeting, end of letter continued from page 4] The paymaster has not
      yet paid us. I hope it will not be delayed much longer. Have you seen Mr. Gillespie? I did not
      get my overhauls. We are now 60 miles from "Memphis". Kiss all for me. Your own
      Samuel.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; "Wiatt" on the "Talahachie" River
      "Miss"&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dec 3d 1862&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Yesterday morning at
      daylight&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Genl Sherman's whole army left "Chulahoma" and marched to the banks
      of the "Talahachie", through mud and drain. Early in the morning it commenced raining and I
      can assure you I never felt more sympathy for men than for the 8th M. Regiment as they in many
      places waded through mud and mire. But what was worse when we reached "Wiatt" it still rained,
      and none of us had any shelter. Cold and weary I knew not what to do. But our men were in a
      worse condition than I was. So I said nothing. The cold rain still continued to fall
      plenteously, and I suppose we must all put up with it, and do the best we could for the night.
      I rode down to the river and watered my horse and returning stop't at Gen' Smiths Head
      Quarters and ate a piece of cold meat and bread (boon) and was mighty thankful. But my horse
      blankets and every thing were out in the rain. So I went out and found some corn and stood by
      my horse while</Transcript>

    <Transcript>he ate it, as thousands of other hungry horses stood round anxiously looking on.
      Still the rain poured down. I thought a good many times of home, and I have been there I would
      not have hurried away. When my horse was through I mounted him and rode back to the Regiment
      with one of our men, and to my joy found Col Smith had taken possession of a miserable poor
      old house, and had a good fire blazing in an old chimney. He called to me, and said "come in,
      I guess we will stay here all night." Never was a mortal more thankful than I. I was up all
      the previous night (after our long march of 18 miles, of which I spoke in a previous letter)
      attending to the mail, and early on the morning of the 2nd we marched for this place. So you
      may suppose I was not a little fatigued. The humble meal we had for supper was relished by all
      our mess. Col Lt. Col. Major. Adjutant Sergeant Major and myself all lay down together on the
      old open floor, and enjoyed a good nights sleep. This morning opened up delightfully. Our men
      are all out and doing finely.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Is'nt it astonishing what men can become accustomed to? They marched in the rain,
      and mud and lay down and slept in the rain and cold and when morning dawned were ready for any
      commands. But my Dear you can form no idea of the destruction of property [sic] all along the
      line of our march. This town had perhaps 100 inhabitants. All had fled before our arrival. And
      not one house has been plundered by the 113 Regiment of Ill. Vols. of whom I spake before. O
      what destruction, &amp; what suffering must ensue in all this country. But they are to blame.
      It is nevertheless deploreable. My Dear, I have just been informed by Col. Smith that it is
      hardly probable that we can "get a fight" with the rebels short of "Jackson Miss." And he
      thinks one more fight will close the war in the Southwest. How thankful I will be when the
      glorious old flag floats triumphantly from "Main [sic] to Louisiana". And from the Lakes in
      the North to the Gulf of the South. Last night two deserters came in from the rebel army.

    <Transcript>Camp of Confusion again April 30th 1863.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My
      Dear&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; It would amuse you not a little if you were here today to see the
      confusion generally which prevails among the sick and convalescent in camp; who are by the way
      about all that are left behind the two armies now opperating [sic] for the capture of
      "Vicksburgh", and it is all owing to the fact that the rebels have crossed over the river and
      are ready to attack our camp. The order has come to pack up.
      Samuel&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Near Sundown.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Well my Dear we are
      all alive yet and in readiness to go wherever ordered. We may be up all night, and we may be
      ordered away in the dead of night. Don't know whose hands we will be in the morning. The
      rebels evidently mean fight, and intend no doubt attacking our camps in the absence of our
      fighting men. The battle has been raging all day in the distance and I am unable to ascertain
      whether any thing has been gained or not. O how I long for this war to end. How I long for
      peace. How will I hail the day when I return to the bosom of my family. My Dear I hope to see
      you </Transcript>

    <Transcript>and my dear sweet children before many more weeks shall roll away. How I would love
      to make garden and fix up the flower beds with my sweet Jennie, my Rosey and Nelly, and busy
      baby looking on from the little porch. Roll on sweet moments, and hasten the time when the
      absent and lonely soldier, shall sit in the midst of the dear ones around the social hearth.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; How beautiful is the spring time. How joyous is nature on
      its return. Here in the south every thing is truly beautiful. The trees are all loaded with
      loveliest green. The valleys are covered with a soft velvet green, and the birds, from every
      group of trees warble forth their sweetest songs. How much I would enjoy a walk with my Jennie
      this evening along the "Levee", if the war was only over. It would be a sad sight to you my
      Love as we would walk along, to see the soldiers graves reaching away along the "Levee" for
      miles, just as closely as they can be made. My Dear you would count them by hundreds. There
      they sleep poor boys far from home. They died too without mother, sister or wife to administer
      to their comfort. O how sad I feel whenever I think of them.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>But I think I would enjoy a walk much better near our own home. I would want Jennie
      on one side and my sweet Josie and Bettie on the other. Willie and Baby and Johny and Annie
      could keep the house from running away. O how nice it would be. But alas how far I am from
      realizing any such pleasure. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My Dear I wrote Mr Jackson
      and Willie and perhaps yourself in regard to planting the new prairie with corn instead of
      beans. But this evening I walk talking with a gentleman from Illinois and he says by all means
      put in the beans. So I will recall my last order about planting corn, and direct that the navy
      bean be put in any way. Try and have the ground plowed and rails hauled as early in May as
      possible. I will come home and help put up the fence, and plant the beans. I will also buy the
      beans myself. I may be disappointed in getting home, but I guess not. I will try for it any
      way. Good night. May your sleep be sweet my Love until we meet again. Kiss my sweet pets and
      receive a thousand from your own Samuel.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Youngs Point La, May 1st 1863&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My Darling
      Jennie&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; This is a lovely May morning. The camp is as quiet as can be. The
      cannonading has ceased, and the opinion is entertained that our troops are successful. One
      Col. from "Genl Rosencran's" army with 2000 cavalry pitched on the rebels at "meridian" near
      "Jackson" Miss., burned 100 Locomotives 600 cars, and 6 months provision of the rebels. This
      is published in the Vicksburg paper. Pretty good is'nt it. I hope I can write more tomorrow
      for you. I want to start for home next week unless I find we are to be paid soon. This will
      detain me. I would not allow any thing else too. I am very anxious about those beans, and
      think there is a small fortune in them. Good morning Love and loved ones. May the Lord be they
      Keeper, and the everlasting arms thy sure defense. So prays your own affectionate
      Samuel.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; P.S. I inclose [sic] a rosebud for Josie and
      Bettie and Jennie &amp; put a Kiss inside of each one.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Samuel</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Helena Arkansas&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dec 21st 1862&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      My Dear Jennie&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I am not feeling as well this morning as I had hoped I should
      feel, when I was writing last night. I have violent pain in my head, and have not eaten any
      breakfast. Col. Smith is dangerously sick of fever at "Memphis", and could not come along. I
      feel sorry for him, he looked badly. These terrible fevers are dreaded more than minic (?)
      balls. "Helena" is not a large place, only 90 miles before Memphis. The buildings look old and
      dilapidated. The country adjoining is nearly all quite as low as the river. This is Sunday
      morning. But O! how unlike any thing I ever experienced or witnessed. Last evening in
      particular, I was ashamed of many of the officers and most of the men. Drunkenness gambling
      and profanity was nearly all that could be seen or heard. Many say and think that it is just
      as creditable to get drunk, and have some fun when you can, as to be sober all the while. I
      have often thought of the married men in our Regiment and others besides, who do very wrong.
      Some go so far as to say, they pay nothing in advance but women ... and they will give their
      last dollar to a woman any time. You understand what they mean my Dear. O I am sick my
      Love!</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I am sick, head, heart, and soul sick, of being associated with such men. I am
      really getting ashamed to own I belong to the Regiment. And yet I suppose it is as respectable
      as any in the service and perhaps as well behaved. Sometimes I think what reward has the man
      who keeps sober? Or what reward has he who despite all and every temptation proves virtuous,
      and withstands all and every endeavour to lead him astray. Tis the love I have for my Jennie
      and darling children, and the grace of the blessed saviour that keeps me from every
      impropriety. But My Dear I wish I was out of the army. I am afraid sometimes I will lose my
      life and soul both. The boat has just stopped. Men are all going ashore to wash and cook. So I
      will stop awhile and see what is to be seen and then I will tell my Love. Your own
      Samuel.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sunday night 11 1/2 o
      clock.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My Dear Wife,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; O what a day I have
      passed. There has been nothing but Drunkenness, Gambling, &amp; profane swearing. There was
      scarcely an officer that was not drunk. Col. Smith was to drunk to come out of his stateroom.
      The Major was the same.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>All the Captains and Lieutenants save two were drunk. But all gambled save one
      Lieut. and Col. Coleman, and he would also have been gambling had he been sober. The Captain
      of the boat &amp; clerk came to my room &amp; told me they felt their boat was disgraced. And
      that the officers and men of the 8th MO. Reg. would disgrace any place. O how I felt, knowing
      every word he said was true. They absolutely refused to give up the tables for religious
      worship, all day long. It was nearly 9 o clock at night when I got things arranged for
      service. The crowd was great and I had the most profound attention. After services we had some
      singing and all the officers save Dr. B. &amp; Dr. Brown, Lt Sterling &amp; Lt Halsey,
      returned to their gambling tables. At this writing which is near 12 o clock at night they are
      still gambling. Now my Dear am I to remain with such a disgraceful set of men? O what is my
      duty, in regard to this matter? Do tell me &amp; pray for your own Samuel. Good night. Kiss
      all for me.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Below "Helena", 2 1/2 miles on the Arkansas shore in the woods&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Monday Morning Dec 22th 1862&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My Dear
      Jennie,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; At this writing the sun is mounting the heavens seemingly in a
      chariot of fire. The morning is very fine, but I think there are indications of a storm. The
      river for miles on either shore seems lined with boats, loaded with troops, stores, and
      munitions of war. Truly it is an imposing sight. I don't know how long we remain here, and
      when we leave, I don't know where we are going. There are in all more than 50 steamers and
      nearly 60000 men. And what my Love are to become of all these men. I am afraid there are not
      righteous men enough in the army to save it. The wickedness of the army, officers and men is
      so great; and on the increase; and consequently alarmingly great, that I begin to entertain
      fears for the success of our cause. I know God is able to make the wrath and wickedness of men
      serve him, and my prayer is that he will do it. Buy my Dear I am now fully converted to the
      belief that if we are dealt with as we deserve we must suffer defeat, and our enemies triumph
      over the nation, and the last hopes of humanity in relation to republican institutions must be
      forever entombed. But O Lord have mercy upon our wicked, our Christless army. And for the sake
      of the few who do fear thee, give success to our arms, and hasten the time when the nation
      shall learn war no more. Amen.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>My Love,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dr. Bailey, Lieut. Sterling, and Lieut. Halsey the only
      sober men in the Regiment among the commissioned officers, have decided to resign, and leave
      the Regiment. They say they consider it a disgrace to belong to the Regiment. I have told them
      if they resigned I would. My mind is fully made up about the matter too. I have asked to be
      relieved from duty: but have concluded to wait till the close of the ensuing battle. If
      spared, I hope now to be home, at least, or at furtherest by April for good, and perhaps
      before. They think if I leave an account of the disgraceful conduct of officers, it will
      reflect a terrible disgrace upon the whole Regiment. But my mind is made up, and cannot be
      changed, unless there is speedy reformation among men who hold commissions in the Regiment,
      but who are positively not fit to be "shoe blackers" to many privates in the ranks. Yea I will
      add more. They are a disgrace to many in the ranks, the boat has just started and it will be
      difficult writing all day. But as this is only intended for the eye of my own Dear Jennie, I
      will continue the scroll, knowing it will be appreciated by the one my heart adores most this
      side of heaven.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Yesterday Capt. Watson of the steamer "Omaha" in the fleet, came on board our boat
      to see me. He sat along time in my state room and talked about many things which have happened
      since our Regiment left "Cape Girardeau". Miss Hattie Campbell whose letter you sent me, is
      his granddaughter. She lives with her Grandpa, with her mother &amp; sister. Her father is
      dead. I boarded with them while at the "Cape". They have the seeds and flower slips for us,
      whenever it will be safe to send them. And my Dear amont the many places I intend you to visit
      is their house, just as soon as we can so arrange our home affairs, that we can leave with
      safety. My Dear, one more disgraceful act perpetrated by 9 Union soldiers has just come to
      light. A blooming pretty young lady was seized and held by 9 soldiers, while each one in turn
      gratified his base desire the poor creature humbled, and ruined for all time, and besides half
      dead. O! O! O! O! the corruption, the terrible demoralization of the army. My Dear, we have
      two sweet little daughters, and I as a father, and their father, with all the warm, and strong
      affectionate attachment of a father</Transcript>

      stroke of providence, which would commit their now delicately beautiful little bodies to the
      quiet repose of the grave. Until the morning of the resurrection, than have them grow up to
      womanhood, and be exposed in any way to the depravity of wicked men in after life. My Love,
      you only can appreciate my feelings in this regard, or measure their depth. My Home is to me
      the brightest, happiest spot on Earth. IT is there my own Dear Jennie is the presiding angel.
      There too are my own sweet children, of whom, with thee Love, ever, I'm fondly thinking no
      matter where I may roam. Tis near thee, and my dear children I desire to live. And whenever,
      or wherever it is my lot to die I ask with my last gasp to lisp the precious names of Jesus,
      Jennie, and my children, and there let me repose in silence, till we all meet again Love n'eer

    <Transcript> Then Love, life's voyage, will be over, Life's cares, anxieties, and toils will all
      be ended, our Hopes and fears will too forever cease; for we then will realize the full

      through faith's dim eye, on earth, we will then behold with unobstructed vision. And it is
      there my Love the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. I am often very much
      interested with this idea: viz., who we shall see, in Heaven – and who we will select for our
      associates there. First of all, if I am so happy as to reach that blest abode, I expect I

      feet, I shall look for the side opened by the soldiers spear, I shall look also for the scars
      made in his sacred temples during the terrible battle of calvary, where the Captain of our
      salvation was wounded, and pierced many times, but was ultimately the Victor, and triumphed
      over every foe, I shall want to Kiss his hallowed feet, and shout his praises as loudly as the
      angels will let me, and as long as the endless ages last, There My Love I shall want to look
      along the sunny banks of the river of life for my own dear Jennie for my sweet Josie &amp;

    <Transcript>cloud the sky of heavenly enjoyments to have one of the dear children God has given
      us, to be absent, or missing then and there. Doubtless Love, you will find a mother there, to
      welcome you to the repose of the skies; And how delightful the meeting will be. Then you have
      sisters [?], and I trust now reposing in the heavenly mansions. O how pleasant t'will be to
      meet at last where no farewells are spoken. My heart is moved with deep emotions, as I
      remember I have now an aged father &amp; mother standing on the banks of Jordan &amp; only
      waiting permission to pass over. I have some others of my own family I hope to meet in that
      bright world. But my Love Tis with thee, &amp; my sweet children I hope to spend Eternity. Tis
      thy society my Dear good Jennie, and my children's, I'm most fond of on earth, and it is quite
      natural I should desire the same through eternity. May this be our happy lot, is the earnest
      and constant prayer of your own Samuel.</Transcript>

      the Regt. My horse is waiting for me now, and as night is coming I must be off. I hope I will
      get a good many letters from you when we get a mail. I am watching anxiously for it every day.
      Write as soon as you can my darling one, and tell me everything that has transpired since I
      last heard from you and now my dear good by. I have looked at the locket &amp; your picture
      many, many times since we started on the campaign, and I love you more every time I see it.

      given my life for, and willingly I would have died for him. His death is the greatest loss

      to prevent your writing. You know, my dear Florence, that I write to you every time I have an
      opportunity to do so, which is not very often. But when I hear that there is a chance or a
      shadow of a chance to send a letter, I indite one at once to you, and it seems to me you might
      write occasionally to me. We receive mails every two or three days</Transcript>

      when my letters are not received, when they are expected, you would write me oftener &amp;

      engagement. On the 13th [illeg] we had a very sharp fight near White Oak Swamp. I had two men
      killed in my company &amp; some very loud calls for myself, but I came out all right. We

      soon have what was the worst Co. in the Regiment the best. They have always been commanded by
      officers who have allowed them to do just as they pleased &amp; it is somewhat difficult to
      convince them that Capt. Sayles commands the company &amp; not the company that commands Capt.
      Sayles. I have had five men shot since I have had command of the Co. &amp; they have done
      about as hard fighting as Cavalry companies usually have. I hope we will receive a mail today.

      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This is the last dated letter sent by Captain Sayles to

      dearly beloved Florence!&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Several days have passed and I have not heard from
      the "girl I love"! If you knew how anxious I am about you I know you would write very, very
      often. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I have just returned from Genl. Wilson's Hdqrs (3rd Cavalry
      Division). The General sent for me, he having received an application made by Major General
      Wm. F. Smith ("Baldy") to have Capt. Jas. A. Sayles 8th N.Y., Cavalry assigned to duty upon
      his staff. Genl. Wilson wanted to know whether I was anxious to go with Genl. Smith. If I was
      not he wanted to take me upon his own staff as Aide de Camp. I told Genl. Wilson to do as he
      pleased about letting me go to "Baldy". He said he didn't think I could be spared from the
      Division, and would order me to report for duty upon his staff. I feel highly flattered by the
      many compliments</Transcript>

    <Transcript>paid me by both Genls Smith &amp; Wilson but I think I will accept of Genl Wilson's
      offer. Genl Smith commands the 18th Army Corps and a position upon his staff is a very
      desirable one and I would no doubt have a very pleasant time. But I think my chances are much
      better for promotion in the Cavalry and I am going to remain with it. I intend to decline the
      A.A. Genl's appointment. I expect by so doing I will incur the everlasting displeasure of my
      uncle Genl Grant but I don't know but that I should have my own interests at heart in
      preference to his. Everything has been comparatively quiet during the past 3 or 4 days.
      Continous picket firing and skirmishing but no battle. A portion of the Army were moving
      today. (the 5th Corps.) I think there are signs of the whole army moving in two or three days.
      We can't remain here on the Chickahominy. Abounding as it down in swamps &amp; fevers for many
      days longer. Here we are after two years fighting, and on this last campaign with a loss of
      over 50,000. As brave soldiers as we were. And not as near the goal [illeg. ] as we were under
      McClellan on the Peninsula</Transcript>

      least so seems to be the intention. How we will succeed God only knows, certainly there is not
      spoken of in the world's history an army composed of better or braver men than there are in
      the Army of the Potomac, its losses testify to that. Where it can't go if properly handled, no
      army can. But you know the Good Book says "All things work together for good for those who
      love the Lord" and I suppose it must be so. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I wonder how you are passing
      away these long pleasant summer days! I hope enjoying yourself! We are having drills. Mounted
      and dismounted. Everyday.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I am getting so tired &amp; sleepy after my long
      ride of about 35 miles today that I believe I will postpone writing further until tomorrow

      letters today, one directed to Moline, one to Albion N.Y. and one to Factory Point, being in

      particularly to hear from the captain who, I am sorry to say was captured by the enemy in
      Wilson's late raid. I should have written you before, but I heard that he was wounded and
      taken prisoner, and as it was nearly summer and I believed it might not be true, I thought it
      best not to write and excite your fears until I could learn something reliable. I went to
      Corps and Army Head Quarters but could learn nothing reliable there. Wilson's Cavalry Division
      was too far away for me to go there, so I wrote to the Asst. Adjt. Genl of the Division and
      have just rec'd a reply, a copy of which I send you.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The information is
      quite unsatisfactory, but we ought not to place the worst possible view upon it, and look upon

      hands of the enemy, but there is no evidence that he is killed or wounded, and therefore we
      ought not to take it for granted that he is.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; You may ask why he was lying
      behind a log firing his revolver when last seen if he was not wounded.The answer is
      satisfactory to my mind and the fact that he was so last seen is some evidence to my mind that
      he is not killed or seriously wounded.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; You must not think that the Cavalry
      go into a fight always mounted. On the contrary they seldom do so, most of the fighting is
      done on foot. The skirmish line or advance always or nearly always dismounts when they advance
      &amp; leave their horses behind. The nature of the ground, the fences, brush &amp; woods, and
      the manner of the enemy's fighting render this course necessary, and if either party is
      pressed or being driven back by the other, they get behind trees, rocks, stumps, fences, logs
      or anything they can to protect themselves and fire upon the enemy. This is modern
      warfare.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; In this instance it seems that his line was not supported properly,
      and it had to fall back. He did not fall back with the line, but got behind</Transcript>

      gallant officer as much as we do. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; As soon as I can I mean to go to the 8th
      N.York Cavalry &amp; talk with the men and learn all the particulars I can and will inform you
      of all I learn, but I can't go for several days. In the meantime, don't be impatient at the
      uncertainty and force yourself to believe the worse, when you have reason to expect otherwise.
      I feel confident that he will come round all right in the end. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; In any view,
      you have the proud assurance that he always bore himself with distinguished gallantry, and
      that he was seen bravely fighting to the last. For one so young he has made a noble

      Blacks &amp; White and Nottaway C.C. where Sayles behaved very gallantly, he must have been
      wounded or taken prisoner in a temporary advance of the part of the line where his men were

      his late raid and on the 23rd June we were engaged with the enemy at "Black &amp; White"
      station on the Petersburg &amp; Burkville Rrd. The 8th made a charge driving the Rebels about
      1/2 mile and was in turn forced back part of the distance during the return the Rebel line
      advanced very close to the squadron commanded by Jimmy, and he commenced to fire at them with
      his pistol taking cover behind a tree for the purpose. He was warned by another officer that
      he should fall back more rapidly</Transcript>

      of the place where the capt was last seen. The above is all that is known except that Jimmy
      did not come back.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; It is possible that he remained firing at the rebels so
      long that it was not possible for him to return without a certainty of being shot or he may
      have been wounded where he has last seen and thus have become unable to return. We report him
      as "missing" and from his known [illeg] his friends entertain serious apprehensions that
      something worse than captivity may have befallen him. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Since that time I
      have almost daily looked for a letter from our Ast. Surgeon who was left (on the 29th) with
      wounded and who may have been able to gain intelligence, as surgeons are not held Prisoners of
      War. We look daily for the release of the Dr. I shall be happy to communicate to you anything

      Jim,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; You must excuse my seeming presumption in addressing you: but after

      you a few things. But before I go any farther, I will tell you that I tried to get Florence to
      write what I intend to; but she, fearing you would think she was trying to slander Alice

      (Alice did the most of it) telling him that Florence was flirting around with Jim Sayles and
      he had better look out or Jim would "cut him out." Rena gave Alice to understand, that Ben was
      corresponding with Florence, and that they loved each other; and Alice wrote the letter in
      order to prejudice Ben against Florence, you can see by that what a disposition is shown by
      both, and if they will write to one, they tell to another; and I expect you will receive a few

      some of Rena's manouvering, and if you should for one moment doubt Florence's constancy, I
      advise you as a cousin to make your doubts known to her, as some one that knows more about it
      than wither Rena or Alice; and have it all explained. One thing that Rena told me was, that
      the night we were up to Charley Woods, you and Alice made all up, and you promised to marry
      her in two years; but the next days you, finding that she still bore Mr. Cady's ring, you had
      a "flare up," and told her you did not wish her to do it and she said she should, you said if
      she did you would not have anything more to do with her, and that ended the "fuss," so says
      the Moline News Bearer. Rena has asked Florence no questions, and she has of course not
      mentioned it, but Rena wears a very sorrowful expression, and</Transcript>

      does not think there has been anything serious in your visits to the "Lee Claire House", but
      thinks if Florence would only be pleased with you, that there will be something very serious.
      She thinks you are pleased. Mrs. Stokes and Rena said that they told you to flirt with
      Florence, in order to excite Alice's jealousy; and that it has turned out just as they wanted
      it to, merely in flirting; they ought to know Florence better than that for she is not one of
      that kind. Perhaps you will think I am trying to slander, but Mrs. Hood, and Pitts first told

      as I have, and not misconstrue my cousinly intentions, for slander as none has been intended.
      Pitts left last Monday morning and it has been so lonesome since you both have gone, that
      Florence and I almost die of the blues, and would if it were not for Phil (Fil) and Hill, who
      occasionally comes to see us. Hill staid here last night and we had a very pleasant time, went
      to bed at twelve, instead of five. Lieut. Jewett called and spent the evening and we were very
      much pleased with him, and if we had not seen either you or Pitts, (which we think no one can
      equal) we might have had a fight for him. We are invited to another of those horrid dress
      parties tomorrow evening and we wish you and Pitts could be here to go as we intend to look
      lovely. I have written a much longer letter than I intended, but hope you will not get out of

    <Transcript>From Georgia, our dear cousin, last evening, containing some very valuable
      information which letter I answered and the letter posted at once.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Georgia
      seems troubled lest I should listen to some tales that may be told me by some of our [illeg.]
      friends (?). Rest assured my dear Florence that if I ever a doubt of your constancy should
      enter my mind (which God forbid) you will be the first person to whom I will appeal, but I
      trust you Florence and I hope you will have the same confidence in me that I repose in
      you.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Of course you know what Georgia wrote to me and it will be unnecessary
      for me to repeat. Rena may but Alice never will write one a letter speaking in anyway
      disparaging of you. Alice Deere knows</Transcript>

      to any of our friends ( she knows us only as such!). If she had the least suspicion that we
      were more than friends, the less likely would she be to write me upon the subject; however
      whatever news I receive from Moline on the subject under consideration you will be duly
      informed of. The message sent by your Mother will be duly considered. I will try and be a
      "good boy". I am highly pleased to know that you like Lieut. Jewett so much. I saw him but a
      very few times and on each occasion he appeared very much of a gentleman and am only sorry

      made most happy by finding a few lines from you awaiting me. You can imagine, I know, with

      in missing the morning train, I could not help but feel pleased that it had so happened for it
      gave you an opportunity to obtain a little rest which I know you needed, after so much
      dissipation and it also gave you time to send me what I so much desired. Tuesday evening

      morning and took dinner with Rena after which important event we all started "en masse" for
      the city of R. Island. As I had expected and as a matter "of course" I have heard numerous and
      numberless remarks concerning your visits as the Lee Claire house. As it is all conjecture and
      as they can find out nothing to a certainty there are all kept in a perfect fever of
      excitement which I hope will soon disappear and leave no fatal effects. Alice said to Rena (so
      Pills says) that she could not imagine what Jim Sayles saw in Florence Lee, in look, that is

      not mistrust that anyone else did. But you do not doubt it do you? Lieut. McNeil brought us
      invitations yesterday to attend a party in Davenport which we declined as it is rather
      unpleasant crossing in the canoe and the ice is unsafe. We were all very much disappointed
      last Wednesday evening by not seeing Father but instead Mother received a letter as the next
      best substitute in which he says that from all accounts he should judge that the girls, at
      least, were having good times with the soldier cousins and dashing Lieut. If I thought you
      would not take as flattery what Mother wrote in answer to that part of his letter I should

      have to say is that he is one of the more captivating, handsome, amiable young gentlemen I
      ever met and I cannot vouch for Florence's heart, whether he took it back to Washington with
      him or not." So you see Mother has broken the ice and much depends upon her if he is pleased
      or displeased as he is hard to suit in such matters. Dear Jim, you say you love me more and
      more every day. If possible, for my feeling read your own heart. You know they correspond and

    <Transcript>A. John Levy (resides in Royalton Court, Niagara Co. N.Y.) says that some one and he
      thinks it was Oscar Loomis told him that when the regt. afterwards came back over the
      battlefield he (Loomis) went to the house near where Capt. McNair was buried and while there
      he heard a darkey say that they (meaning some darkies) buried a "boy Captain" under a large
      Oak tree the day after the fight. Lt. Wells tells me that Capt. McNair and Capt. Sayles and a
      Lieut. Of the 1st Vt. Cav'y were the only officers lost that day and that the Lieut. was
      buried by our own men. The negroes said those that they buried were buried by order of the
      rebels. Our men held the railroad until nearly eight the next morning and then went on toward
      Staunton river. Loomis lives in Rochester near Pennfield.</Transcript>

      officers and men speak of him everywhere where they knew him. Nearly every one has some kind

      that, if I should fall, I might be buried on the very spot where I fell. No one can say but
      that your less is great yet you have much to console you. You feel badly to have him die away
      from friends and in the hands of our enemies but would you rather that his soul had not been
      stirred with patratic zeal at his country's call, and he remained at home and died of disease
      with friends around? I know you would not. If</Transcript>

      could not have chosen a nobler or prouder death. You cannot but sorrow yet, you have something

      the other letters is a particular account of the death of the noblest and most generous of
      your sons who died as he had lived, the bravest of the brave. Any Spartan mother might well
      have been proud of such a son: one who said his last moments "I scorn to turn my back upon my

      antiquity met death with greater courage, fortitude or composure. He was captured on the 4th

    <Transcript>on the next day, the 5th, by order of Col. Wm. H. Powell: Comdg Avenill's Division
      of Yankee Cavalry. He was captured by a party of fifty Yankee cavalry after he had made the
      most desperate efforts to escape, having killed two Yankee lieutenants and a private, having
      discharged all the load from his Spencer (seven shooter), carbine and his Colt Army six
      shooter. He did not surrender until he was himself wounded in the left side and the Yankees
      were shooting and cutting at him on all sides. May God comfort you in this hour of
      afflication. All of your brothers &amp; sisters are well. I am in excellent health. I have
      resigned my commission and am going into the ranks. A Crittenden need hope for nothing from

      for the friendly man even had he the genius of Caesar or Buonaparte. It is pleasant to think
      that this administration will go out of power in less than three years. I prefer the ranks to
      a position where there is no chance of promotion. Every man has his day of prosperity, Mr.
      Davis' day of adversity may come tomorrow. The wheel of fortune keeps rolling. I am far from
      despairing. Yes, I am more determined than ever to overcome all obstacles and all opposition.
      God does with us what he will, so I am content to abide in my time. I am much in need of
      money. A check on any person in the North is worth but little. A draft on a bank at Nassau or
      London is worth more than gold. The words "payable in gold" should be included in the Draft. A

      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; That fixed look of care and sorrow which is so striking in every lineament
      of the likeness which you lately sent us fills my soul with the keenest anguish. I would most

      pain or grief. But that can not be for God has deemed it otherwise. It is to that almighty God
      that we must turn this the hour of our bitterest affliction. He that afflicts alone can
      comfort us. Let us entreat of him strength, patience, and resignation. May he bless you with
      his Holy spirit and enable you to bear with resignation and fortitude the death of they oldest
      and noblest son. His noble and gallant</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I would make especial mention of the kindness which my brother and myself have ever
      received from Uncle George, Uncle Willie, Aunt Lou and Aunt Beck. They have all endeavored to
      make us comfortable and contented. Aunt Lou, Uncle George's wife, is the best Christian and in
      all respect the most lovely woman I ever met. She is the best friend I have in this Southern
      Country. If you could only know how sweet, how kind, and how good she is, you would love her
      very dearly as all others do. Gen. Jos. R.A. has acted in the most noble manner. I got out of
      funds and he, on my mentioning the fact to him, offered me all I might need. I am anxious to
      repay him. What school does Howard attend? Tell me all about him, Parker, Carrie &amp; Tom,
      about you all. How is Tom's hand? Send me a Photograph of each member of the family.
      Commending you all to the care of God and entreated you to place your trust in him and rely
      solely upon his mercy,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Affectionately, Yr.

      the esteem and affection of all who served with him. He was even the first to volunteer on the
      most dangerous of difficult service. It fell to the lot of a man named Hartigan to accompany
      him. They proceed to Brubaker and procured provisions, the rest of the party setting out to
      water their horses at a stream about a mile from camp. As brother and Hartigan set out on
      their return to camp, twenty five Yankee cavalry rode up to Mr. Brubaker and enquired who
      those men were. Mrs. Brubaker replied "soldiers." The Yankee gave them instant pursuit. This

      then carried the Lieutenant and private who were mortally wounded to their camp near Luray.
      Brother and Hardigan were taken to the same camp. Brother stepped into a house in Luray and
      kneeling at the door in sight of those who had him under guard wrote a few lines to Uncle
      George stating that he was slightly wounded and a prisoner. Aunt Beck has these lines and will
      keep them until they can be safely sent to you. All who saw brother in Luray tell me that his
      fearless bearing and courteous dignity towards his captors was truly noble and remarkable.
      From Luray he and Hardigan were taken to the Yankee Camp. On the next morning, they were
      marched under guard to the Hd. Wr. of Col. Wm. H. Powell, Comdg. Averill's Division of
      Cavalry. It is said that Col. Powell asked them some questions and then ordered them to be
      taken to a ravine nearby and there shot. All that is known as to what</Transcript>

      to citizens. They stated that Hardigan did not behave well and that he begged and entreated
      Powell to spare his life. Brother, of whom they all (the Yankees) spoke in terms of the
      highest admiration and praise, received Col: Powell's cowardly and brutal order with the
      utmost composure. They stated that his calmness and self-possession was worthy of the greatest
      admiration. I have not been able to ascertain whether he made any reply to Powell's brutal
      order. From Powell's tent they were marched about a half mile to a narrow, precipitous and
      rocky ravine situated in the place of a Mr. Bean about a mile north of Luray and about 300
      yards to the right of the Luray &amp; Front Royal Pike. The squad who were to shoot them, fit
      instruments for so damnable a deed, halted them in this ravine and then said to them

      several times through the back. Churchill, as those who shot him afterwards related calmly
      replied "Running is something I never think of. If you intend to murder me you can do it." Or
      words of similar import. He then coolly seated himself upon a large rock, folded his arms and
      received their fire. The only ball that struck him hilled him instantly, passing through the

      resist the inclination to love him. Aunt Lou, Uncle George's wife, is the dearest friend I
      have. I beg that you will love her for my sake. I feel that I can not speak too highly of the
      affection and kindness shown us by all our relatives. I enclose a likeness of my brother. I
      beg that you will have a copy taken and send it to Miss Maggie Brown, Hanover, Indiana. Please
      send me by each of your letters or any opportunity that occurs a likeness of some member of
      the family. I shall send one of my brother by every letter. I am much in need of funds. I have
      borrowed some money from Gen. Anderson who has acted most nobly. Fifty dollars in gold is all
      I need. A check on a Yankee bank is not worth half as much as one on a foreign bank. Le the
      check be payable to my order. I am well. Love to Aunt Mary and family. Also Aunt Annie. My

      dearly beloved brother Churchill, your peerless son is dead. He was murdered by the Yankees on
      the 5th of October 1864 near the town of Luray, Page County, Va. I will endeavor to give a
      full and true narration of the circumstances of his capture and subsequent murder as I
      obtained them from Lieut. Waters, from eyewitnesses of his capture and from others who heard
      the Yankees speak of the noble and fearless manner with which he met his
      death.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Lieut. Waters and twelve men (12) of Company "C"
      1st Md. Battalion of Cavalry, Churchill among the number, were sent out on a scout sometime
      during the latter part of September, 1864. His party was cut off and forced to remain in rear

    <Transcript>pursuit of Gen. Earley. Lieut. Waters and party met on the 1st and 2nd of Oct. a
      party of five Yankees. In the fight which ensued two of the Yankees were killed the three
      others captured. As the Yankees had then entire possession of the Valley, Lieut. Waters and
      party hid themselves in the woods at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, some three or four
      miles South of Luray. Churchill volunteered on the morning of the 4th of October to go for
      provisions to a Mr. Brubakers who lived about a half mile from where they were then hid. The
      other men drew straws to determine who should accompany him. The lot fell to a man named
      Hardigan. A party of some twenty five (25) Yankees rode up to Mr. Brubakers a moment after
      brother and Hardigan set out on their return with provisions. This</Transcript>

      inquiring "who are those men," Mr. Brubaker replied "soldiers." The Yankees pursued them
      immediately. Hardigan, who was a very timid man though mounted on a fleet horse, surrendered
      immediately. Brother, though badly mounted, did his utmost to escape. He killed a Yankee
      Lieutenant who was the first to enter the field in pursuit of him and mortally wounded another
      Lieutenant who had taken a short cut and headed him off. He also mortally wounded a Yankee
      private. Though Brother kept his horse running at the top of her speed the Yankees, who were
      well mounted, continued to gain upon and finally entirely surrounded him. Churchill continued
      to fight them until he had discharged all his load, and was himself slightly wounded in the
      left side.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Then only, when he was unable to make any further resistance and saw that any
      further attempts to escape would prove fruitless, and only cause his descruction, did he think
      of surrendering. [overwritten in ink: Lieut. Waters &amp; party were at this time watering
      their horses &amp; heard nothing of brother's capture before that night when they became
      uneasy about him and went to make inquiries. This accounts for them not coming to brother's
      assistance.] The Yankees took him through Luray to their camp a little North of that town. He
      stopped for a few minutes at a house in Luray and wrote a few lines to Uncle George, telling
      him of his being slightly wounded and captured. I shall keep these precious lines, the last he
      ever wrote, until I can safely send them to you. Those who observed him during the brief
      period of his captivity declare that his behavior toward his captors and guards was remarkably
      courteous and dignified and his bearing bold and fearless. Churchill and Hardigan were marched
      out under guard early on the morning of the 5th of October to the Head Quarters of Col Wm. H.
      Powell, Comd Officer of Averill's Division of Cavalry. It is said that Col</Transcript>

      by Yankee officers to have been done in retaliation for the two men who were killed in the
      fight in Luray on the 1st or 2nd of October. It is certain from the statements of Yankee
      officers that brother not only declared but proved who he was and to what command he belonged.
      I know the names of some of the officers were parties to that cowardly order and murder. It
      will not be long before I get the names of all the officers belonging to that command,

      moment was truly grand and noble. Such courage, such magnaminity would have moved the hearts
      of brave men or those who had one grain of noble sentiment in their souls: it only increased
      the thirst of those fiends for his blood. From Col. Powell's tent they were marched to a
      ravine a half mile from the Yankee camp. This ravine was small, narrow, rocky and precipitous.
      The Yankee squad who had been ordered to shoot them halted them in this ravine and said to
      them "You may now run for it." Hardigan ran but was shot through the back and killed
      immediately. Churchill who remained perfectly calm and self-possessed in these most trying
      circumstances quietly observed "I have no idea of running: if you intend to murder me, do it,"
      or words to that effect. He then seated himself upon a rock, faced his murderers with his arms
      folded over his chest and fearlessly received their fire. It seems that only one man fired at

    <Transcript>Richmond Va&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Jan. 14, 1864&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My
      dear Mother&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Your letters of Sept. 29 &amp; Oct. 19th 1863 I rec'd on the
      2nd. These are the first letters I have had from home since May 63 and they were very
      wellcome. Those letters written since Cousin Margy left the South will not reach you, some
      were destroyed and the rest were so directed that they could only reach you while residing in
      San Francisco. I have written a great number of letters since I came South and shall continue
      to write by every chance. I expect soon to go West to join John H. Morgan's corps. and I may
      get a position. I have friends who know [illeg.] and who will do all they can for me.
      Prospects are better now than since I reached "Dixie's fair land." I will have fewer
      opportunities than ever for transmitting letters after I go West but I will do all in my power
      to write so as to remove any anxiety you may have on my account.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>So far I have been very fortunate. I have never had my clothes touched. Often after
      coming out of a fight I have looked in wonder to find that I was not touched. I have been
      where shot could almost be seen, the air was so thick with them. Last spring 75 of our men
      were ambushed by 450 infantry, 250 cavalry and a piece of cannon. Half of the command was kill
      and wound. I was the only one whose clothes were not touched. I had my tooth brush in two
      button holes of my jacket and it was broken into a hundred pieces. I have had three horses
      killed and four wounded while in front of the enimy. Do not think this boasting, I give these
      that you may know that I am trying to do my duty. At the battle of Gettysburg our Battalion
      was drawn up in the rear of a battery when the Yankees commenced shelling us. Myself and
      several others who were on the right of the line were watching the enemy from a little hill
      when a 64 pounder fell in our midst, it appeared to reast a moment and then rolled down the
      hill about 20 yards and exploded with a terrible report. If it had exploded when it fell all
      would have been killed or wounded.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>The family is the same as when I last wrote you. Uncle George has five (5) children
      all very interesting. Aunt Beck is in the Treasury Department and gets 75 a month, she lives
      with Uncle George. Lorraine is here and Uncle William is expected today with his wife late --
      Miss Mollie Mac [illeg.]. Aunt Mary when last heard from was well, also Uncle Joe. Uncle Alex
      has been chased from Brownsville, he is in Texas. Uncle Churchill is dead, he died in Texas,
      his wife was with him. Aunt Jo made him a very good wife and is much liked by all who know
      her. Lorraine will be captain soon. Cousin George B.C. is here and has promised to do all he
      can for me. I shall not trouble him much for I dislike asking favors of any one. There are
      several Cal-nians here on business. One is about to go to Manhattan and he carries this
      letter. Tell Howard to be contented where he is, let him do well for he may have to support
      one or both of his brothers before the war is over. But if he will come I will see that he
      does well, better than James or myself. I would ask</Transcript>

      Here I am near your old home and some distance outside the Pickets. A few days since I saw
      Aunt Mary, she and all the family are well, the baby is as fat as fat can be. Charley has
      grown to be a fine looking boy and a most useful son. He is a great assistance to both his
      parents and a great comfort. Aunt Mary has rec'd Father's note of Dec. 20th, 1863. This is the
      last news I have from home and as it is later I feel comparitively easy about Pa prospects.
      The note was written in Virginia City. Brother</Transcript>

      back to the Western Deptment. Aunt Mary has only one servant, a stupid negroe woman. That
      money by Dr. Will was lost by the Dr. so it is lost to J- and I. I send a lock of my

      has gone into the service. Uncle William was captured and paroled at Vixburg, he has been
      exchanged he is in Richmond. He will not go back to the Western army. Aunt Beck is living with

    <Transcript>The spirit of the army is just as good, the people are as resolute and the President
      is as much admired and respected though not as much loved as when the war began. Congress is
      doing all in its power to strengthen the Army and the executive, if it does as much for the
      Fianance all will be well. All those Regiments that go out in the Spring have reenlisted. The
      North will feel in its own breast the blessings of War before three months. I send you the
      last address of the President of the Armies of the C.S. My love to all my
      relations.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Your loving son,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;

    <Transcript>Does not go through, your letter will do.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I feel very nervous
      today. Last night I did not close my eyes till 6 o'clock in the morning &amp; then after
      dropping off into a doze woke up before 8. I thought I should have gone mad. If it had been
      possible for me to leave my business without [illeg] to others I should have started this
      morning for California. I shall grow more quiet. Do not be uneasy about me.

      April 10th 1865&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dear Mother;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; There is no
      longer an Army of Northern Virginia. Lee surrendered the remainder of his army yesterday
      afternoon, about 20,000 men, I believe. The last hope of the Rebellion is extinguished. They
      are and feel themselves to be a whipped people.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; From
      Richmond and Petersburg, the two parts of Lee's army, cut in two by the charge of the 6th
      Corps on the 2d inst, retreated westward and effected a junction at Amelia C.H. Grant pursued

      from retreating South to Danville. Lee's arrivals were in poor condition. His trains moved
      slowly and delayed his army which depended for rations on these trains. So Grant was enabled
      to overtake him, and pass Sheridan and two Corps, the 5th &amp; 24th, around his flank and in
      position in his front while the rest of our forces pursued him in war. By the map, you will
      see a road from Farmville to Appomattox C.H., north of the Appomattox River. Lee took the road
      but found Sheridan posted at Appomattox C.H. in force, while the 2d and 6th Corps were
      thundering in his rear. Gordon's Corps, formerly</Transcript>

      Corps) but were beautifully whipped. Lee then had no alternatives but to surrender, or have
      his army crushed between our columns. So he surrendered like a sensible man. So ends the
      Confederacy. Grant will parole them and let them go home. Thus in a campaign of 7 days, the
      rebel army which has held us in check for four years, was annihilated, not a fraction left. We
      find wagons and artillery scattered everywhere through the woods. At our Provost Marshal,
      Capt. McGinley was riding along a negro came up and said "Are you Abram Linkun?" "No!" "Are
      you Gen. Grant then?" "No!"</Transcript>

      could see men throwing Rebel money into the streets by basketsful. What a glorious end to this
      war! I expect to be home for good in a few months now. No more killing. No more going under
      artillery and musketry fire, and shouting yourself hoarse, trying to push up the men. Our

      and all the generals rode around through the army, and such cheering I never heard. One
      regiment the 61st Penn. cheered me, the first time I have been cheered since the Highlanders.
      My new horse almost threw me. She was very much frightened. All the artillery fired salutes.

    <Transcript>late in the fall before I shall get home.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; We
      were thunderstruck night before last by the news of the assassination of the President. The
      first effect was to cause a feeling of great bitterness towards all rebels. It is well known
      that sums of money have been offered in different parts of the South for the murder of Mr.
      Lincoln. The murdered was no friend to the South.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I think,
      however, the President's death will not seriously delay the restoration of peace and union.
      It's [sic] chief effect will be to make us a little harder on rebels and that is no harm. The
      leaders and instigators of the rebellion</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Hampton, Va. July 13th, 1863&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dear
      Mother;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; We are now awaiting steamers to transport the troops to Portsmouth.
      The Division reached here this morning, and are now going into camp. We will probably be
      delayed here several days.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; It is now certain that this
      Division is to garrison Portsmouth for the rest of the summer, a most disgusting prospect, and
      a fate from which I hope to escape. Corcoran and his Michies will be sent to Washington,
      where, it is to be hoped, they will be placed in the front
      ranks.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The weather is delightful, but very hot, and there
      is the greatest abundance of blackberries.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I had a letter
      from Mande a few days ago. She wrote from Andover, where she was having great times, riding
      the pony, &amp;c.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Hampton, before the war, was a
      delightful little town, very aristocratic, with broad streets, fine brick mansions, and noble
      shade trees. The Episcopal Church was the oldest, and certainly the most aristocratic, in the
      United States. The inhabitants were all F.F.Vs [First Family of Virginia] and looked down upon
      the rest of mankind. They would hardly associate with the officers at Fort Monroe and their
      families, whom they considered as low and parvenu.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Soon after the war commenced, John Magruder, in one of his drunken fits most
      probably, laid the town in ashes, and the destruction wrought by him, thorough as it was, has
      been completed by the large army of McClellan which passed through last year, and by the
      negroes who have demolished the old blackened ruins of Magruder to build their own little
      shanties along side. The place is now a negro colony, not a white inhabitant remains; only the
      walls of the old church are left standing; the church yard walls is broken down, the graves
      and tombstones are defaced and mutilated, and a company of cavalry are grazing their horses
      within the old church yard, where repose the ashes of the most illustrious of Virginia’s
      families. Such an utter desolation have two years of war made in this once flourishing
      town.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The whole peninsula, in fact, was desolated by
      McClellan's army. From the White House to Hampton, scarcely a pig, chicken, cow, horse, or
      living thing can be seen. The fences are all gone, except here and there where they have been
      rebuilt and a scanty crop put in, and the houses, such as are not destroyed, look dilapidated
      and ruinous.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; It is very [different] in King William and
      Hanover Counties, which we traversed in the expedition to burn the R.R. bridge over the South
      Anna. These counties have hitherto escaped the visitations of either army, and with them all
      is flourishing. I saw splendid crops of wheat, which</Transcript>

      anxiously awaiting news from Maryland. When once the great armies of the rebellion are

      rest easy in regard to my safety for the remainder of the summer. We have the inglorious and
      useless part of garrison troops to play, a fine commentary on the wisdom of those in power,
      who retain the only fighting division in the Dept. to rust in sloth and idleness, while they
      send raw end inexperienced levies to the battle field.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I
      hope you will write often. I hope to see you this fall or winter. As soon as active operations
      and all chance of doing something, are over, I shall apply for a short leave of absence. Good

      1861&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dear Mother; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Since I last wrote I
      have been very busy. We occupy an exposed point, our pickets are constantly in hot water with
      the enemy's, Gen. Smith stampedes and we are continually in a state of alarm. Night before
      last we had a grand stampede, the troops were all under arms for some time and occupying
      position all about, strong working parties were busily digging in the trenches until after
      midnight and the troops were finally ordered to lie down on the ground besides the trenches
      with their arms in order to be ready at a moments notice; yet no enemy made his appearance,
      and we had our trouble for our pains. I say "we" for convenience, but I sleep in a house and
      don't wake up for any alarms.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I have been in two small fights since my arrival. They didn't either amount to much,
      so I wasn't much frightened.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The shells and rifle cannon
      they talk so much about don't amount to much. I was exposed to their fire and take this
      opportunity to expose them. If they hit a man they may hurt him but I saw 30, or 40, of them
      go way over the heads of our troops and burst 200 yards beyond them. Whenever a shell would
      come the men and officers would drop on their hands and feet and "sing small". They were just
      as safe standing up, but didn't have sense enough to see it. I will write you more fully soon.

      Dear Mother;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The letter containing your money is no doubt at Harper's Ferry,
      the nearest post office. The Postmaster would not let it go without a receipt which no one was
      there to give. I shall send a man for it tomorrow.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The
      colt I bought a few days ago for fifty dollars, I sold yesterday for one hundred dollars. Not
      a bad speculation, and the 50 gained comes very opportunely just at this time. I hope you will
      not be pinched for money. I have been out nearly all day trying to find another, but the
      country is stripped bare. We now have to send five and six miles for hay, and scarce at that.
      The sufferings of the people will be severe this winter, I am afraid. They are much abused by
      stragglers, &amp;c. All the poultry, sheep, pigs, within five miles are gone, stolen by the
      men. Nearly all the meat, bacon, hams, &amp;c also. Nobody who has witnessed the ravages of an
      army</Transcript>

      During our fight, a few days ago the rebel skirmishers cheered loudly and repeatedly for
      McClellan. Ours for Lincoln, Poor [strips?] for candidates. Late in the afternoon I was sent
      with orders to a detachment of cavalry some three miles distant on our right flank at a place
      called Jackson's ford. On arriving there no cavalry could be seen except a number of grey
      backs just across the creek and from a boy riding up the road. I learned that our cavalry had
      gone back some time before. While talking with this boy, about a dozen or fifteen rebels
      called out to "hold on", and commenced riding pretty fast towards us. As we were but three
      men, we did not "hold on", nor did they overtake us. I don't think they chased us far. They
      were only a few hundred yards distant when they called to us to stop.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Everything here betokens a quiet fall in the valley. Both

      fortnight ago I was riding along the picket line of the 19th Corps, which was then within

    <Transcript>Clifton, Va&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sept. 18, 1864&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Dear Mother;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Punch would find rare pickings in the army. The everyday jokes
      and incidents of campaign life are rich enough. The other day in a cavalry charge the enemy
      broke and a rebel soldier was chased into a fence corner whence he could not escape. "I
      surrender! I surrender!" he cried to the pursuing trooper. "What do you think of the old flag
      now!" replied the soldier aiming a cut at him. The men in the ranks get off many a good thing.
      It is curious to see what a zest some of them take in man hunting, skirmishing, scouting and
      the like. They are as much pleased when they bring down an opponent as a successful sportsman
      with his bird.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Everything has remained in its usual quiet
      since I last wrote. We have a most beautiful little camp for Headquarters, and are quite
      comfortable. I have gone to the length of building a stable for my horses, and if we don't
      move soon shall think about building a chimney for my tent. We have plenty of
      grapes</Transcript>

      very well off, as fare as physical comfort goes.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; General
      Grant M.L. is here, which looks like action. Probably to see what is doing and whether any

      As for McClellan, he will make a worse failure as a politician than as a soldier. I think his
      army strength is all gone. Few are left of his old army and they have changed in their
      feelings towards him to some extent. Nowadays they are making everybody Brevent Major General.
      Here is Amory for one, a contemptible fellow, half traitor. A General Kelly, who has been
      almost invariably beaten, telegraphs "I have beaten Imboden, cut [off] Johnson, and am now on
      the heels of their main army", all false, and behold! He is made brevent Major Gen'l. Such a
      miserable lot of scamps as seem to control affairs in this republic. I am almost tempted to go

      Dear Father &amp; Mother,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Your letters have both been
      received. I was much grieved at the sad tone of both. Of course we all deprecate war. But
      since the question of our existence as a nation seems to hang upon a thread, and in case a
      dissolution takes place war is inevitable. I say let it come when we are best prepared and
      when we have the national prestige and resources to back us. Who wishes to see a reenaction of
      the Mexican feuds. There if a party fails in a Presidential election it immediately sets

      me. I am very glad to have those who care for me, but I cannot bear to have their bosoms rent
      with anguish. If there could have been anything that would have deterred me from the course I
      have chosen it would be the thought of plunging my parents into affliction. I appreciate all
      you have done for me. I shall try to be a faithful steward of what you have bestowed upon me.
      Of course we none of us know the chances of war. I may return with honor and invigorated
      constitution. I hope by a prudent course so to do. Camp life thus far has been as easy for me

      Dear Mother, &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I am going on a dangerous scouting excursion to night. I have
      not tried as hard as I ought to be good. Yet I trust in God. I mean to do my duty. Good Bye.
      Do not borrow unnecessary trouble about me. Should any accident occur to us, you will learn of
      it immediately. I hope your prayers for me are not in vain. Rest assured</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Last night some of the 79th went out &amp; caught two guerrillas.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The rail road is not done this far yet so we have had no
      news sinse [sic] we come here. The last news we got was very good. Grant &amp; Sheridan was
      going in heavy. The news of Richmond being ours with so many prisoners &amp; so much artilery
      [sic] was so good that we felt like going crazy &amp; our old batteries fired a salute. Lee's
      army is "gong up" now &amp; so is the Confederacy. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I wish
      I was going to school with you &amp; help you take care of them girls. I intend to start to
      school as soon as I am a citizen again but hardly know where I will go yet but I think I will
      go to Philadelphia as I have a cousin teaching in a Commerical College there &amp; is
      profassor [sic] of the branches I wish to study. I have not made up any mind yet to what
      business I will follow.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Our mail has just come in &amp; I
      got a letter from my ________ but it was very dry. I have a notion to write one back as dry to
      retaliate, what do you think I had best do.</Transcript>

      Kentucky&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dear cosen
      [sic]&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I know this opportunity this pleasant evening to
      rite [sic] you a few lines, to inform you that I received your letters maled [sic] April the
      18th. I am glad to know that you are all well, and glad to, to hear of the fine meetings in
      your country. I have nothing of much importance in riting [sic] to yow [sic], more than good
      health and that Isac Butram and Thomas Hancock's daughter Milley joined the right hand in the
      tie of wedlock not long since, and he is living at old Tomes. The last account I had from
      William Hurt, that he was a going to pop the question to Miss Mary Rigs. I will commence the
      joke rite [sic]; George Butram and bill is cropping [sic] together: George said will was
      plowing a long one day all at once bursted out in a big laugh, George says what is the matter
      nothing much says bill, tell me say george: I was laughing about what you toled [sic] me to
      ask Mary next time I saw her if she dident [sic] want her name changed and if she said she did
      ask her how she likes the name of Hurt.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; George I'll be
      cofound if I don't pop the question next time I see her. I think Bill would marry if he knew
      how to ask a girl to have him. I will quit this subject for the present, requesting you to
      pity your cosen [sic] billey. It is hardly necessary for me to say any thing about political
      affairs. I am sorrow to hear of so many boy's after my darling MJ though I cannot help my
      self, I wish I could rite [sic] something inticing you to tell her, I have not the time at the
      present, I will rite [sic] a verce [sic] for her.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Believe
      me this I do protest, believe me what I say;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; You are the girl I do love
      best, untill [sic] my dying day.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I will close my letter inscribing my self
      as your cosen.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; James V. Butram! rite [sic] as soon as you
      get this letter.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>&amp; it has bin [sic] so wet this spring we haven't broke very much corn ground
      yet. I am living with Joseph. He gives me 27 dollers [sic] per month clear of expenses till
      the 1st Dec. I see a gay old time so pretty much as I please. I aim to raise potatoes onion
      &amp;c, &amp;c. this year. For next the people say that is a good enough sign of what a person
      intends but I don't know how I will come out yet. You said Jonny Twas aiming to raise a
      company to protect your country now if you will come out to a free country you will not need
      to be gwarded [sic]. There is two [sic] much treason there for me unless I cowld [sic] be
      allowed to stop some of it and I think I have done my share in this war.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Columbus Ky Jan 5th, 1864&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Cousin
      Jasper&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Once more in time I embrace the pleasant
      opportunyity [sic] of droping [sic] you a few lines in answer to your very kind and
      interesting letter which came to hand some weeks since I would have written ere this but heard
      of so much fighting down there that I thought it useless to write. I have no news of interest.
      This is new year and we are all busy. I am still teaching. My school has six weeks of being
      out. I enjoy teaching so much. I don't think I will ever follow any other employment. Well, I
      saw some Christmas though could not enjoy myself with a free good will as my mind was fillid
      [sic] with thoughts of other days when all was quiet and peace at home and abroad. Oh! That we
      had peace as in days of yore. I am so tired of war yet I am still in for a vigorous
      proscention [sic] of it until the last trailer quails beneath the fire of Uncle Sams Boys. I
      hope yet to see the Star Spangled Banner floating over the United States as in days when we
      knew no war. Well we have some snow nowadays in old Adair. It has been snowing two or three
      days and is still falling slowly. The white flakes (apearing [sic] as so many large feathers)
      are chasing each other to old mother earth where they find a temporary resting place. Oh! That
      I was a little child again so that I might enjoy the childish sport of snow balling &amp;c.
      Well I am not married neither is there any prospect of such an occurrence. I have a widower
      bean tis true but then he and I are not taking on any. I am the same wild mischievous Wagen
      and could not live if it were not for a spice of romance occasionally. I don't think I could
      love any one. My hearat is too calous [sic] and I know no one could love me so I will be an
      old maid.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Glasgow Barren Co. Ky. Oct 30th, 1864&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Mr.
      Butram&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Kind friend once more I have the honor and pleasure
      of transmitting a fewe [sic] lines to you in answer to a very kind and interesting litter
      [sic] which came to hand in due time bearing date to the 29th Sep. I was very glad to hear
      that you was all well and doing so well and I hope you are doing better now for I hope you are
      on your way home. Father was passing your Pa's Thirsday [sic] and stopped to see them and your
      sister told him that Mr. Kinselow told them he saw you all at Cattanooga [sic] on your way
      home. So I think you certainly will be here very soon, say by the election. any how your Pa's
      family were well. We are also all in good health at preasant [sic], but I must tell you that
      the gurillas [sic], 27 in number, was to see us last Tuesday. They wore [sic] not very welcome
      [sic] guests I can assure you. They rushed rite [sic] in upon us without a minute warning. we
      dident [sic] know they were in the country untill [sic] we see them come gallopping [sic] rit
      [sic] up to the house and come dashing rite [sic] in and demanded our armes [sic]. The first
      thing whasis [sic] that pistol I was told there was one here (we didn [sic] know that it was
      known we had a pistol). John found it it was a mighty good size shooter worth $25. He kep
      [sic] it under the head of his bed but they went rite [sic] to serching [sic] the house one in
      the big room another in the little and then in the kitchen. They serched [sic] boxes ban boxes
      drawers trunks and every thing they wished. They found Fathers little drawer locked. They
      ordered us to open it. We did so. They got his pocketbook and seched [sic] it. There wasent
      [sic] much in it but they dropped a part of that and dident [sic] see apart. So they dident
      [sic] get much if any money. They sayed [sic] thare [sic] was a damned site [sic] of papers in
      thare [sic] and they tossed them all out in another drawer.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Father had a very nice little rifle shot gun he buaught [sic] this summer. He would
      not of taken a horse for they took that and the pistol and the best horse we had and some
      other little notions. Father got to the house just before they left. They wanted to know whare
      [sic] them armes [sic] was, whare whare is your pistol he sayed [sic]. He had no pistol he
      never owned one in his life. The jerked it out and shewed [sic] it to him supposing he would
      know it but he did not. I steped [sic] up and told them that was my pistol it was not his at
      all so they hushed about that and ordered Father to get them a bridle in dam double quick. he
      commenced getting for the horse and diden [sic] go rite [sic] off and they jerked out there
      [sic] pistols and swore they would blow a hose threw him if he didn't make hast [sic] and get
      a bridle and one rose along behind him punching him on the head with his pistol. I got scared
      for fear he would shoot Father and told him I would get him the bridle that Father was
      crippled up so he couldent [sic] get along fast he sayed [sic] dam you get it then (that was
      the first time that I have ever been cursed you may guess how I felt it is better immagined
      [sic] than told). So we got the bridle and off they went one leeding [sic] and one beating for
      the horse was very contrary so they caryed [sic] him 2 miles and undertook to drive him so he
      jumped over fences and got away and came back home. So that is pretty much the way they served
      all along on the road. They choaked [sic] Cousin Cary Snoddy down and beat him over the head
      and took $100 from him. It was Magruders gang but enough on that subject unles [sic] it was
      better but I must tell you that Eliza Bowles and Armit Sanders was married last Thirsday [sic]
      and Lewis Word and Elisy I. Mathews the Sunday before but I must close kindly asking you to
      excuse the uninterestingness of this letter and write soon to J.N. Butram from Lucind I.

      high spirits. The boys are looking forward to the 17th of Sept. when we will once more retire
      to a private life. The boys are very anxious to get out of the service, under the present
      program of things, and I am sure that I am Keen to retire from the service. I have a nice
      little wife at home, to take care of, and things don't go on to please me. No way. So I have

      Bertram&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Respected friend I take pleasure in writing a few
      lines to you in answer to a kind favor written the 26th Feb. having already delayed writing
      too long in hops [sic] of sending you some news. I will commence at once as your facilities
      for obtaining the truth are not much better than mine. There are so many conflicting rumors
      continually floating about that I am getting to believe none of them and to make as few
      calculations upon the futur [sic] as possible. I shall therefore send you nothing in the news
      line that I don't think correct. In fact for the two or three last weeks nothing has
      transpired worthy of note we are still pestered with a verry trubblesome [sic] set of soldiers
      at town. I thought</Transcript>

      I am really tiered [sic] of hearing of coald [sic] meat and bread for it is evry [sic] day and
      many times every hour they are calling for it from this candid and free expression of my
      feelings. I do not wish to convey the idea that I am disposed to find fault with soldiers who
      has been rased [sic] right or has self respect in looking back over the two last years. In
      which I have mingled some in the society of the soldiers I cannot say. I have derived no
      pleasure from the post that I have seen, no satisfaction. It would be base in gratitude were I
      to disclaim participation in some delightful scenes where sympathy and affection warms the
      soldiers heart and the pleasure</Transcript>

      blessed with good health peace and tolerable pleanty [sic] at this time for which I feel verry
      [sic] thankful to the giver of all good and I do sincerely [sic] hope this may find you and
      your brothers and my brother and all they boys blessed with similar blessings. I received a
      letter from B to day written 24th Apr. Stating his health to be verry [sic] good which I am
      glad to hear at any time. I received a letter from my rebel brother Allen last Saturday
      stating him to be in good health as far as fisical [sic] ability was concerned but suffered
      some from two wounds he received in the left leg. I was glad to hear from him although we
      differ in pollyticks [sic]. He was at Demapolis Alabama the letter came by flag of truse [sic]
      and he was not allowed to write news but I must bring my scribling [sic] to a close. Excuse
      bad writing all defects which are many. Write soon. I send you a song ballet which I think
      suited your case about 3 weeks ago. Perhaps you know it. If you don't, come over and I will
      sing it for you. I remain your friend.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Farewell from

      at 3:20 P.M.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; My dear Friends at
      Home:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I am so "happy" I don't know what to say. You know I
      don't drink but I realy think, I should like a cup of tea at about this time. Well at last we
      have realy broken the "Back Bone" of the Rebelion. We have had a hard time of it I assure you,
      but I feel well repaid. Many are barefoot as the country is rough and stony. The soles of my
      boots are worn off and for the past two days I have marched with my feet wound in pieces of
      cotton tenting. My feet are quite sore, but I was bound to see the "last ditch", and I believe
      we have found it. For I now consider the Rebellion virtually
      over.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Why I feel as though I was almost home. Yesterday
      our cavalry captured five trains of cars, five hundred wagons, and 42 pieces of artillery. We
      travelled most all night to get up and support the cavalry and with our legs accomplished it,
      and got here just in time as the enemies infantry was driving back</Transcript>

    <Transcript>our cavalry and would have escaped south had we not blocked their game by getting on
      their only road. Lee and his army were marching south between two ranges of hills with our 2nd
      &amp; 6th corps persuing him in the rear, while our corps and a part of the 24th corps with
      the cavalry by a circuitous route on the left flank got this position. There is a small town
      here called Appomatox Court House where Lee, Grant, and Sheridan met to arrange the terms of
      surrender which are "conditional" but might have been unconditional if Grant had required it.
      But I think it is, and should be the policy of all in authority to conciliate as far as
      possible without sacrificing our own honor. The "conditions" so far as I can learn, are these;
      Officers and men are to retain their personal effects, the former their side arms, and all to
      be paroled on the field.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The best of it is the Rebs are as
      pleased over the affair as we are, and when the surrender was made known to them cheer after
      cheer went up along their whole line. Their southern pride is strongly humbled and I think a
      majority of them will be better citizens than before. What an eventful week the past has been.
      One week ago yesterday the 5th Corps nd [illeg.] took the South Side R. R., thereby turning

    <Transcript>force with a part of the 24 Corps again turned the key that locked Lee in. All the
      old army of the Potomac has ever lacked was good leaders but thanks to the powers that be that
      want was supplied at the proper time, and you see the result. I can't realize the turn of
      affairs. It all seems like a dream. Perhaps it is well I can’t for it might [illeg.] me. I do
      believe the past week has been the happiest of my life. The thought that the army of the
      Potomac has at last accomplished what it has so long bled and sweat for. Little Royal Scott
      and Robert Smith are all here and safe, each doing his duty to the
      last.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The bands are playing and the armies are cheering,
      "Sweet Home", "When Johnny Comes Marching Home," and "Hail to the Chief" seem to be the
      prevailing pieces. Many, many are the hearts made glad this day and many more will be made by
      the news. I suppose you are all crazy with joy up north. If you are not, you should be. On the
      5th, I saw Lute Ives and. Bro. Lem but have not heard from them since. The weather is very
      fine and has been since we started, favoring us very much. We are leaving Mich May weather and
      the leaves are budding.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I have had no letters that were
      written since my return, but expect some. No more now!</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Monday morning the 10th&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Last night it rained a
      little and is still lousy. Many rumors but nothing official. I have not seen Gen'l Lee yet.
      The work of turning in arms and parolling will commence this morning, and will probably take
      two or three days. Rumor says our corps is going to Lynchburg. No mail going out
      yet.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Good by all -
      Billy&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Evening&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; We have
      just been notified that the mail leaves Hd.q - in one hour. All quiet and nothing startling to
      relate. Our army and the Rebs are visiting very cordially. Many of the Rebs were over taking
      supper with our men. They have a keen relish for a cup of Yankee coffee. It is regular Jubilee
      for both armies. A Big thing.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Remember me to all enquiring friends if they
      are loyal - Love to each &amp; all the family, so write one and all.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Adieu&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      William.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; P.S. This is a specimen of Reb.

      attack made upon Vicksburg yet cant know when there will. According to preasant [sic]

      have had quite a heavy force down at Vicksburg &amp; they are runing [sic] down by thousands
      now. There has been not les than 15000 passed here in the last three days. It is my opinion

    <Transcript>you said that Dubuque Co. had always been loco &amp; that since the war broke out it
      seemed to be worse &amp; that you did not know why it was so. I can tell you just the reason.
      It is because nearly all the loyal men have enlisted &amp; gave in defence of their country,
      leaving the traitors at home to rule matters there. Well I don't know as I have anything more
      to write this time &amp; as I am not in good trim at all just now for writing. You will please

      Mississippi a few miles above Vicksburg) sailed up that til we came in the rear of the city
      &amp; within a short distance of the enemies works where we disembarked &amp; on the 27th Dec
      our forces under Gen Steel engaged the enemy in an open field and on the 28th drove them back
      into their entrenchments with concederable [sic] loss on both sides. Our brigade had not yet
      been called into action but on the 29th we were called in and that under a galling fire from
      the enemies batteries &amp; sharp shooters &amp; by a portion of the 58th Ohio surrendering
      just in front of us. We our Regt. came well night being taken prisoners but by some
      Providential preservation we escaped loosing [sic] a man &amp; only 8 wound in our Regt. The
      4th Iowa lost a good many. We gained nothing after the enemy were driven into their
      entrenchments which are naturally strong by being situated on a high range of hills &amp; they

      our up from the Yazoo my health was vary [sic] poor, so poor that I was not able to be off
      from the boat at the taking of the Arkansas Post. Since we have been here my health has got
      better though we have seen as rough times as men generally get to see. We are in a low flat
      country and it has rained nearly all the time. There has been vary [sic] little done here
      towards taking Vicksburg since we are came down though our forces are all the time at work
      making preparations. I cant tell anything about when the attack will be made upon Vicksburg.
      It is a strong place and will take strong work to take it. Our Mortars and gun boats are
      throwing a few shells over into the city nearly every day but as yet I believe they have
      accomplished little or nothing more than to get the range. I am not prepared to give any
      farther information concerning our movements here. Our forces are stretched along the river
      here for some 10 or 12 miles. There is a great amount of sickness among</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Lincoln, Page Co. Iowa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; October 27, 1861&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dear
      friends, I will indeavour [sic] to penn [sic] you a fiew [sic] lines in a hurry for all I do
      in these days is done in that way. It is hurry to fight then ditto double to work &amp; then
      it's hard scratching to get along. We have pretty troublesome [times?] here now. It becomes us
      as lovers of the union to be up &amp; a doing. The rebels are getting pretty saucy since their
      victory at the battle at Lexington. They are driving the union men out of Missouri by scores
      &amp; confiscating their property. Were it not for the Iowa home guards Northern MO would show
      a different aspect today from what it does although it is bad enough as it is. Our company has
      been called out every 3 or 4 weaks [sic] all summer and has not succeeded to get a scratch
      with them yet for as soon as they find out that the Iowa boys are coming, they disband &amp;
      take the brush &amp; stay there &amp; never show their heads until we are at home &amp; about
      our work again. I wish you was here to go down into MO a while this fall with me. I think we
      could scare up some of them if they are in the brush. I think there would be a chance to have
      a little fun with them at any rate. We are all well &amp; hope these fiew [sic] lastly lines
      will find their intended receivers in good health &amp; prosparity [sic].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Yours with respect&lt;br&gt; S.D. Dunmire&lt;br&gt; 1st Lieutenant of Tarkee

      calk as that will tha cant afeet [?] nothing buy their chat. Thier is no dont bit what tha
      think that consiarvetive partey will hafte to tak sides as long as I am a living bean. I never
      will onless a grat change. I am not in for freeing the negro rather am I in for desolving the
      union. I wish that all the disloyal mens negroes to be taken and colonized on some ilant [sic]
      or sell them to help pray the expence of this war &amp; thin [sic] treat the abolition party
      the same way. There is a nough, a nough loyal men to protect the old constitution if the will
      tak hold of the thing wright [sic] and I think it will be don [sic] if the abolition partey
      comes out. I considder [sic] my Self a volentiar [sic] for three year longer if nesesary [sic]
      and my part will be under the old Stairs and strips and in the defence of the old constution
      [sic] if I am permited to liv [sic]. This rebellion cold [sic] be put down in a hury if it
      wasint [sic] for the love of money. The love of money is the gratest [sic] evil hat the human
      man poseses [sic]. This war has caused the life of many true patriates [sic] and we should
      simpathise [sic] with their friend in their lonsom [sic] and didstresing [sic] hours so we

      pardin [sic] me then I cold [sic] hav [sic] the fase [?] and sadisfaction [sic] but as I am I
      cant giv [sic] sadisfaction [sic]. A man in my condition and of my turn is liabel [sic] to be
      lead astray whin [sic] the are so many attracting thing of the world for man to [?]. I want
      you to know that I gard [sic] aganst [sic] that as much as I can and I entend [?] to without a
      chang [sic] being hear and being at home. Their [sic] is a grat difrence [sic] we never show
      no preaching. I hant [sic] heard a searmont [sic] preacht [sic] since we weas at battle creak
      [sic]. I [t]hink that if I cold [sic] be at meating [sic] and hear good preashing [sic] it
      wold [sic] be a sadisfactin [sic] to me. I hav [sic] often [sic] thought that my day has past
      are and my [?] is fixt [sic] for that affil [sic] world to be my home though I hope for the
      beter [sic]. I intend to try as long as I liv[sic] to bege [sic] for mursey [sic] without a
      grat [sic] change. It looks to me that it tis imposabel [sic] for a man to keep his mind on
      the things that he ort to &amp; a very easy matter for him to kep [sic] his mind on the
      thinges [sic] that he shold [sic] mat but it tis the nature [sic] of man. I cold [sic] expres
      [sic] my feealinges [sic] and mind better if I cold [sic] see you when I set down to write a
      letter to you. My mind is all ways scattered and torne [sic] up so that it tis imposabel [sic]
      for me to giv [sic] you my sadisfaction [sic] about eny thing [sic] attal [sic].</Transcript>

    <Transcript>My friends,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; How soon we are called upon again to
      mourn and publicly to express the feelings which move us. One of our old associates, a leader
      among us, as he was in the armies of his country has perished upon the field of glory. The
      colors of his regiments in his clenched hand, he has died as the brave love to die. His whole
      mind was given to the enthusiastic encouragement of his troops, at the instant the death shot
      pierced his temple! How little like are such scenes to those in which we best knew General
      Stevens in this office, and yet how fully persuaded we all have been that just so he would act
      under such circumstances. He was not one of those who led by looking on, but by example. As we
      knew him in the Coast Survey Office, so he was in every position of life,</Transcript>

    <Transcript>of life, so in action, in civil life, so in the
      field.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Brought up to an active life upon his father's farm
      near Andover, Mass, his bodily frame had early been hardened, and his spirit had shared in the
      process, so that energy and mental power were developed in a well knit frame. He was prepared
      for West Point only by the instruction acquired at the common school, and yet was so prepared,
      that by the exercise of the faculties with which nature had richly endowed him, and which
      labor had shaped, he was prepared successfully to cope with many older, many better
      instructed, many more accomplished than himself, and to wrest in the hardy Academic struggle
      the palm of the generous West Point stripe, the first place in a distinguished class. His
      friendships were many and ardent, and he was admired as well as loved. The spirit of self
      reliance which he cultivated and which circumstances aided</Transcript>

      selected the Engineer Corps of the Army as affording him the best opportunity of usefulness,
      laboring by study and practice to prepare himself for any career which might offer in the
      future. He was distinguished in the war with Mexico, [?] Captain for Meritorious and gallant
      services at Contreras and Churnbusco and Major for Chepultepec. In 1849 he was selected by the
      Chief Engineer General Totten to fill an application for an Officer in charge of the Coast
      Survey Office, and with words of commendation which showed how well he had served his chief
      and his country in his career in the Engineers. This place he filled, more than filled, for
      four years, with a devotion, an energy</Transcript>

      stimulate, to encourage, communicating some part of his own hopeful and ardent character to
      those connected with him. His very fault of thinking too favorably of men was the source of
      much good to them, for it often induced them to efforts which otherwise they would not have
      made. H is sense of even handed justice was very great, he gave it to all, and expected it in
      return. His tact in bringing about a sharp and well defined result even in a complicated case
      was very remarkable, and his drilling of those employed by him to precision, which was one
      manifestation of this quality was wonderful. Generous and noble in his impulses he left our

      his services, and hope for his future success. He left us to conduct the reconnaissance of the
      North Western Pacific railroad route, to be Governor of Washington Territory, and the leader
      of its people in a fierce and savage Indian War, to be its delegate in Congress, a volunteer
      at the breaking out of the rebellion, the Colonel of a distinguished regiment in the Volunteer
      Army of the country, a brigadier general, the hero of the well fought field of Chantilly. We
      claim the privilege to mourn him with his associates in the Army, with the citizens of the
      State of his birth, with those of the State of his adoption, with his countrymen of the Union,
      who educated him, and to whom he gave his life.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; We mourn
      him as heroes should be mourned. We embalm his memory in our hearts as Massachusetts has
      embalmed his mental remains. We preserve his spirit in our hearts as Rhode Island has his

      his skull with his musket. There were other deeds of desperate valor, I cannot record them. Jo
      Jurls, Co. A climbed the parapet, seized a Johnny officer, wrestled from him a fine field
      glass, which he afterward sold to Dr. Smith for $16.00. In the after part of the day I went to
      the hospitals. Oh the agony there! 33 wounded from our Reg. good many slightly. Gen. Beam
      wounded in the arm. Clay Mathews had his leg amputated. At the farther hospital I saw one man
      raving, he was off by himself on the ground; it was all one man could do to hold him down. A
      Johnny boy, young, laying with the rest asked me as I came by, for a blanket, I asked him if
      he was badly wounded, he said no: only an arm broke, he was a pretty innocent looking boy
      about 15 or 16. How horrible I</Transcript>

      erased. Oh: War, how terrible may I never see thee more: The negroes after the charge on Fort
      Gregg formed ready to charge on a still larger fort beyond but the order was deferred till
      morning, when they found it [illeg sequence] near Fort Gregg all night, burying their dead
      conrades. It was dark when I left the hospital. I wanted to go to the train, but wandering in
      the darkness I got lost going a long way of my my road and only successed in finding the

    <Transcript>Friday, April 7, 1865&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; all over, riding a small
      black horse. Very nice. Halted awhile at Rice's station 10 miles from the junction, while the
      6th corps train pulled in from another road. Quite a large number of prisoners just taken in
      captured by the 24th A.C. &amp; 6th. The enemy had thrown up long lines of fortifications
      here. Kept moving till the mud stopped us around 10 p.m. From a hill here we caught the first
      sight of the Blue Ridge peaks towering high. The Roads been muddy all day, many teams played
      out, wagons remaining in the mud. Came about 15 miles.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Saturday, April 8, 1865&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; At 2 a.m. roads being corduroyed
      somewhat we started, what wading and miring through mud! One team failed to pull on a bridge
      till some of us gets into the mud about knee deep and assists them by lifting. Was an awful
      place. Gained through Farmville</Transcript>

      on a hill beyond. Been some fighting nearby. Learned definitely that the 123rd &amp; 54th were
      captured, but nothing from the 116th. Farmville is a nice town. Saw some teams going to the
      rear for supplies. Sent my Mrs. letters. Saw a paper yesterday, great rejoicing everywhere,
      northward over the capture of Richmond. Pleasant day. Travelled till about 11 p.m. Lt. Genl
      Peters overtook us, said 116th all right, were sent 15 miles down the Danville R.R. to remain
      till further orders, which they had not received &amp; he was going on to learn concerning it.
      They of course had nothing what only as they foraged it. Cannonading in front. Country good.
      Kept the Lynchburg road till about 5 miles before stopping when we turned to the right,
      considerably going in a northwesterly direction, been going previously in a southeasterly
      course, fences making good</Transcript>

      Everything is encouraging.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sunday, April 9,
      1865&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Moved in good season. Marched hard. Woods on fire,
      filling the air full with smoke, making it disagreeable indeed. Rebs are being picked up all
      along. Saw &amp; heard a man talk concerned who had lost an arm at Seven Pines, said Lee
      passed with about 10,000 men on that road, terribly scattered, many were deserting to their
      homes &amp; said that no Virginians would fight out of their state. The woman living there had
      lost her husband in battle, he was buried in the dooryard, Found one reb with his family by
      the roadside, a deserter, who said he was surprised to see how kindly "you all are."

    <Notes>William T. Patterson, originally of Athens County, Ohio, served as a Quarter Master
      Sergeant with the 116th Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry. In this diary excerpt he comments
      on the fall of the Richmond and observes -- in the vernacular of his day -- the attitudes of
      the runaway and soon-to-be-freed slaves his regiment encounters while moving across Virginia.

    <Transcript>Journal No. 5 New Series,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Chattanooga Tenn. Oct. 27,
      1863&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; To Mrs. Martha Hoskinson, Rushville
      Ill.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dear Blessed Wife, &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Before you
      shall have finished reading this journal you will come to the conclusion that it contains a
      record of some at least of the most eventful periods of my life, or I am mistaken in my
      judgement of the matter. I shall Preface no further but proceed at once to my narration. In my
      Last Journal No 4 Sept. 12th I left off in the Chickamauga Valley in the State of Georgia. And
      now commence at the same spot.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Mon., Sept. 13th Three
      O'Clock&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Roused and ordered to up and issue three days rations, Obeyed, again
      laid me down to sleep. Slept about an hour when we are ordered to march immediately. So we
      pack up and away, but judge of our chagrin where we find we are marching right back again to
      the Lookout Mountains just crossed. Arrived at the Mountain foot about 9 O'Clock Mon., and it
      is now nearly sundown and here we sit in the broiling sun, all day, waiting, for the narrow
      road to be cleared so we can get up. Genl M Cook &amp; Escort went up about an hour since. And
      our Brigade are climbing while I write. Stuart is cooking us a little supper. Why we are going
      back; or where to or what for, no one knows. I shall not cumber this paper with a repetition
      of our return trip unless some accident. Night x Mail in but nothing for us.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Stuart, in the meantime, had wandered into an old camp at some distance and found
      about two pounds of pieces of hard bread that had lain there for two weeks or more in the dew
      &amp; sun. He gathered it carefully up and put into his haversack. I told him it was God's
      will that we should get away, and I was determined to try it that night &amp; should like to
      have him along. So he now consented, and went and laid himself down by a fire and fell asleep.
      Here I let him stay while I made ready as he had worked hard all day and must be tired. I went
      and informed our Chief Physician and asked his advice. He said he would not advise in the
      matter but if it were his case, he would go very quickly. I took from him a message to his
      Col. In case I should be able to reach the Regiment, took an affectionate adieu and left him
      to go to his rest. His name is [Thomas] Magee of the 51st Ill. At half past 9 o clock, I
      roused Stuart, and told him it was now our time to be off, as to stay later would only
      increase the vigilance of the Guards. We had that day killed a small beef and the cook had
      stowed the meat in an open box in the cellar. I sent Stuart to get about two pounds of this
      beef, which he did, of steak. Now all was ready to make the fearful plunge for
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Our Escape&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; We rolled
      up our gun blankets, put our Haversacks and took our canteens in our hands and went to the big
      spring (Crawfish) as if we only wanted water. I talked out loud, coughed, xc as though nothing
      unusual was passing. Got some water, went back till near our Hospital, then crossed the road
      westward toward another in the woods, at some little distance went along the line of tents as
      though we were going to the most distant one, then slipped off into the darkest shade we could
      find, momentarily expecting to hear the word "halt" or the still more fearful crack of the
      mini rifle and perhaps one or both of us lain low in the dust. But our God sent His Angel and
      we passed unseen and unharmed the dry leaves and little twigs seemed to crash with fearful
      noise. About 3/4 of a mile out we came to the regular Picket line, the path was in the edge of
      an open field and beaten to powder so thoroughly had it been marched. Here also we passed
      unseen and darted into some high corn that was nearby, passed through this into a thick dark
      wood of much underbrush, moon shining almost bright enough to read by. We now rested for some
      time, then arose and went on in a direct line Westward toward the Lookout Mountain, about six
      miles distant. The first four miles of this, was thick woods, then we came to some farms.
      These we passed through, carefully avoiding the Houses. Finally we came to the great
      thoroughfare of the Chickamauga Valley. A road that runs its whole length at the foot of the
      Mountains. Here are posted what are called Videtz [videttes] Cavalry men, who go in squads of
      four, to six, and traverse the road constantly at all hours, day and night. These also we
      passed in safety, reached the tall dark Pines at the mountain sides and were safe, thanks

    <Transcript>be to God for such a deliverance. Here we sat down and rested, ate a little bread
      &amp; water. Then up and commenced climbing the rugged steeps of the mountain, whose top we
      reached at half past two, on the morn of the 26th.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Tired
      almost to death, scarcely able to drag our weary bodies another rod, crept into the top of a
      fallen hickory tree, laid us down on the bare ground and covered with our gun blankets. Would
      have slept pretty well only it was so chilly, the wind was high and very cold, so we had to
      turn repeatedly to keep warm. At length the beautiful sun rose in his might and commenced
      dispelling the chilly air. We now arose and tried to kindle a fire, but our matches were all
      spoiled by sweating in my vest pocket. Stuart was much vexed at this, as he wanted some warm
      coffee so badly. This we could not have now. So we for the first time in our lives had to eat
      fresh beef raw. This, with some of our sunburnt bread and water, constituted our breakfast. We
      are now able to eat anything that turns up, even to Tadpole Soup, made of muddy water. We now
      came to the conclusion that we would climb "High Point," one of the highest peaks of the
      mountains at whose foot we had slept. It is a mountain of rocks upon the top of the range, and
      is at least 200 feet higher than the balance of the mountain and is in many places
      perpendicular. We commenced winding up its fearful sides till at last we came to a pretty good
      path, so we now soon reached the top. Now a scene of unparalleled grandeur is presented,
      Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina &amp; Mississippi. All in sight of one view, from
      this dizzy cliff. We are here above the flight of the Buzzards, as they flew beneath us in
      flocks and at times flew nearly in our faces. Here we could see all over the rout of the past
      night, and look upon our watchful enemy, now many hundreds of feet below us. Feeling quite
      safe, I sat down and commenced penning these notes, and Stuart amused himself gathering dwarf
      chestnuts and sweet birch, when all of a sudden we are startled by the sound of human voices,
      and looking at our pathway, behold two secesh upon us within ten steps. Providentially both
      men unarmed, one an old mountaineer, the other a young soldier of the 3rd Confederate
      regulars. Both parties were scared of us and us of them. They now commenced asking us who we
      were, where we came from, and how we came there. I told them we were a part of a large body of
      Gen. Grant's men, who were posed at Cooper's Gap, some few miles south of this point. They
      then asked how many of them. I said several thousand, but could not tell exactly how many, and
      that they were in charge of a vast supply train. Part of this was truth, and the balance
      fabrication. Grant has a large body of men at or near the Gap spoken of and the secesh are
      trying to keep them from coming down. They now asked us how we got through the (blank)
      pickets, as they had a strong guard posted this side of that force. I told them I had seen any
      pickets at all. I now took the offensive and asked them questions to keep them from quizzing
      us. I asked about the great battle, about their resources, about the state of society,
      country, productions, xc. Together with the Lay of the mountain, roads and water, whose hands
      it was in, xc, xc. They strongly advised us to go down on the West side and travel the
      Summertown road, which they said led direct to Chattanooga, now 16 miles distant, right at the
      end of the mountain. That this route was perfectly safe, xc. Stuart took this bait readily,
      "but the old fish" would not bite. So we shouldered up our little traps and started. I asked
      them if we could not get down in a diagonal to the road spoken of. "Yes," they said, "and
      strike it about three miles distant." We now started and as soon as I got safely away from
      them, I told Stuart our only hope of safety</Transcript>

    <Transcript>was on the top of the mountain and I would go no other way, that those fellows had
      set a trap for us, which subsequently proved true to the letter, as it proved afterward to be
      a grand secesh thoroughfare. Stuart did not like this, as he was so tired of the brush and
      rocks, but we kept directly on the top of the highest part of the mountain, sometimes it was
      fine, smooth and grassy, at other times it was rocks, piled on rocks, so that the road was
      fearful to travel. Occasionally we had to cross a small miserable farm. Carefully we avoided
      all roads, paths &amp; houses till about the middle of the afternoon we began to suffer for
      water. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; At length we came to a deep Gulch in the Eastern
      side of the mountain. I told Stuart I felt satisfied there was water in there near the bottom,
      but it would be a hazardous trip to get it. We consented to risk it and go down, found a fine
      spring, got all the water we wanted, and again commenced climbing the mountain in a diagonal,
      or slanting, direction. After a time we came to a path beaten to fine dust with horses' feet.
      I told Stuart this was quite likely a picket line and the quicker we got away from it the
      better. So we made good our retreat from its presence but had only gotten about one hundred
      yards when we heard low talking above us and in front. Judge of our dismay, when we looked and
      saw a large company of secesh cavalry climbing the mountain in the opposite direction to us,
      and only a few yards from us. We laid us down in the weeds and grass quietly as scared
      chickens, and this danger also passed away &amp; we unharmed. Again I thanked God for His
      deliverance. We must now cross this road, and as it lay at least 50 feet higher than we, and
      it must be passed at least 100 feet more before we could hide again. As the ground was of a
      blue slaty formation and very steep it took a great effort to climb it in time, as we did not
      know what moment another set would come along. When we reached a place where a large tree had
      torn out of root, I tumbled myself into the hole, nearly exhausted, with the effort of
      climbing. Here we rested a little and again mounted up the mountain side out of sight of the
      road.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; We again took up our line of march directly on the
      mountain top, frequently crossing paths that were much worn, but saw no one to molest us.
      Nearly night we came to a low place on the mountain, and a considerable farm and a house. Here
      we concluded to get a little fire and make us some coffee. Disappointed again, for on nearing
      the house we found we were at the place where the aforementioned "summertown road" came up to
      the mountain top, and here was a regular pickets stations. Horses had stood here by scores and
      here were the fresh beds of men. We got away from this place as rapidly as we could. Now had
      we gone this road as directed we should still have been in Dixie, no doubt of it as the road
      was dusted to powder at from two to six inches deep. We soon came to a thick clump of
      underbrush and found an old hollow chestnut stump with one of its sides gone. In this we
      concluded to make our nest for the night. Commended ourselves to God and laid us down to
      sleep, and was only awakened by the noise of the birds on Sabbath morning of the 27th and the
      last Eventful day of our captivity. On lying down at this place Stuart remarked for the first
      time as following: "Pap, I am sure the Lord is directing us, or we could never have come this
      far without being captured or shot at." I replied I was confident of it, for this scripture
      was constantly before my mind "The heart of man deviseth his way, but the Lord directeth his
      steps." &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sept. 27. We now arose thanked the Lord for His
      Goodness, ate</Transcript>

    <Transcript>some more raw meat, took a little bread and water, and resumed our perilous journey.
      Had considerable trouble keeping away from the road, as it wound many times so close to the
      cliff that it was difficult for us to keep hid. We could often see it and see the dust rise as
      the secesh cavalry rode along. At length however when we thought we were getting along finely,
      Stuart stopped all of a sudden and whispered "Pap, this mountain runs out here, look how it
      falls off," I looked and within fifty yards of us were four horses, with saddles on tied to
      some bushes directly in front of us. We dare not risk an approach so we retreated some 150
      yards, and tumbled us down the almost perpendicular rocks on the West side of the mountain. A
      large stream was now visible and a Rail Road so we were quite sure that Chattanooga was not
      far off, and that this stream was the Tennessee River, and the Rail Road the Nashville and
      Chattanooga. The trouble now was to know who held possession. So on we jumped, crawled and
      fell till some 200 feet down the precipice we ventured to look back and saw two secesh
      standing on a huge rock looking down in an opposite direction. Still on down, down, we tumbled
      till we came to a smoother place with some underbrush. Here we halted within about a quarter
      of a mile of the rail road and waited about an hour for some one to pass that we might find
      out whose hands we were in, but none passed. We now crept to within about thirty yards of the
      Rail Road and sat for about another hour in a thicket, on the edge of an old camp, still no
      one passed. So I got tired waiting, and got up and crept softly out, where I could see, and
      found we were in the immediate vicinity of three inhabited houses. Whose knew not, so dare not
      approach the. We now crept softly back to the mountain foot and passed along the rocks and
      &amp; brush to the foot of the steep mountain we had left, here the Rail Road came close to
      the river, and we climbed up on some rocks and hid among the bushes, where we could watch both
      road and river. In a few moments Stuart whispered "Pap, I see one of our men in a field,
      beyond the river." I crept to him and we soon discovered several of them. We now determined to
      get down and hail them. We went as near them as could get for a creek that put into the River
      at this point and hailed them. They answered with "Who are you, and where do you belong," I
      answered them and they began to holler foolishness at us, such as “say rebs, have you any
      whiskey over there, do you see any rebs, come over and get some coffee, xc, xc. I did not
      answer them any more, but went up the stream some distance till it looked shallow enough to
      wade, where we pulled off our clothes and waded over, then redressed in part and went to the
      river again, lower down where it looked as though we could wade it with some effort, and no
      small danger. Here we concluded that there was only one way of safety left us, and that was to
      cross the river, and no time to be lost at that as it was now almost sundown. So we got six
      pieces of light rails, some small grape vines and constructed a raft of sufficient size to
      carry our clothes, and we would wade and push it over, as I knew Stuart could swim but little
      I instructed him, in case he got beyond his depth to hang fast to the raft with all his might,
      so we tied our clothes up in our oil blankets, set them on the little raft and launched it
      out. We had only gone 20 feet from shore when both of us were beyond our reach in water and
      our raft carrying us down with fearful rapidity. I now told Stuart not to get
      frightened</Transcript>

    <Transcript>but lie on his belly and kick slowly but firmly toward the shore we were leaving. I
      crept to the opposite side and threw myself on my back with my feet under so I could kick in
      the same direction using my right hand for a steering oar. We soon found we were making fine
      headway although rapidly floating down the stream. Every little while I would let myself down
      and feel for bottom, but it was "nicht da" (not there). After we got out about 150 yards from
      shore I touched bottom but could not stand in the sweeping current, so we kicked on about 50
      yards more, when we could easily touch but could not check the raft. It dragged us "[illeg]"
      down the river. We held on to it however till a still more shallow place was reached where we
      held it firmly and waded steadily to shore. By this time some hundreds of men lined the shore,
      while our hearts swelled with joy that we were again with our own "blue jackets." I was so
      much chilled, I could not talk, or stand to put on my clothes. Some of the men held me up and
      helped me dress. The men were the 40th Ohio on picket duty and their Col. told us he had to
      give his men express orders not to fire on us, till he could determine who or what we were, as
      for two days past and up to an hour or so before we came to the river, secesh by scores had
      stood at the same ground and fired over at our men, many of them dressed in our uniforms. This
      accounts for the men treating us to foolish talk, and exposes another fearful danger that we
      were not aware of. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The Col. now ordered us some warm
      coffee, and then that we be taken to Gen. Whitacre who must hear our story immediately, so we
      drank some coffee &amp; went to the Gen, who was rejoiced to see us, he asked numerous
      questions about the battle, the secesh, what we saw &amp; heard, xc. He now gave us an
      excellent supper, bread, beef, potatoes &amp; tea. Then ordered up two of his horses and two
      Orderlies to accompany us, and sent us forthwith three miles into Chattanooga to Gen
      Rosecrans, who he said, must hear our story at once, it was of too much importance to wait
      till morning. Crossed the River on a Pontoon Bridge, and arrived at the Headquarters of the
      Gen, at about half past nine o'clock. He was very busy, and set us up with one of his
      principal aides to a tent at some distance, where we were taken separately and questioned as
      before and our testimony taken down in writing, and then read to us to see if it were correct.
      We were now thanked and dismissed, just at this moment a brisk skirmish took place in the
      outskirts of the city, and Stuart and I climbed up a sharp steep to try and see the fight but
      could not for the smoke &amp; dust. Here we fell in with some of the Signal Corps, who when
      they heard our story, I heard told their own marvelous escape from the same mountain heights,
      took us with them and gave us a good place to sleep and some of their blankets to sleep on,
      slept soundly without fear, until sun up on the morn of the 28th. They now gave us some
      breakfast, and we set out to find our Regiment. Now, as usual in the very front of the Army
      and in the face of the Enemy. At least half the Regt dead, wounded &amp; missing. The last
      time I drew rations for 417 men and now it is only 233 officers and all our noble Major Smith,
      Adjutant Winget and Capt. Rice among the slain. Capt. Rice is the noble Tennessean, who
      captured the six men on the retreat from Tullahoma. He carried his Exccentricities to the very
      last, for</Transcript>

    <Transcript>when the men tried to carry him from the field, (the blood gushing from both his
      sides, as he was shot quite through) he said "Law me down boys and save yourselves, it is now
      all over with old Jim," He called himself "Jim Rice." He was a most gallant soldier. But I
      can't detail here.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; I told Col's Jaquess and Davidson my
      story and was then sent to Col. Laibold commanding our brigade. The col heard us out and
      praised us highly for our soldierly conduct and sent us to Gen. Sheridan commanding our
      division. The Gen asked me a great many questions and then praised us for our soldierly
      conduct and thanked us for the information we had given, ordered us a pass over the river to
      hunt our wagon train &amp; dismissed us. We now went to the Col of the 51st Ill. And delivered
      the message from his Doctor at Our Prison Hospital. Told him our adventure xc, He gave us an
      excellent dinner. We now crossed over the river and hunted our Train but could not find it nor
      anybody who could tell us where to go to hunt it. We found out in the meantime that we were in
      the vicinity of the 115th Ill. So we struck out to find Co D of that regmt. Capt. Huckstep.
      Found them after some tedious hunting. Capt Huckstep badly wounded in the thigh, George A
      Gillett of Bainbridge &amp; Francis M. Dupee dead and several others of our noble Schuyler Co,
      boys more or less badly wounded. Their regiment lost just about half its members. It was their
      first fight since in the service. Lieut Samuel Hymer is in command of Co D. We staid with
      these noble men till morning who divided with us their scanty store. Told him our story
      received the necessary directions how to find our Train, saw &amp; conversed with George
      Frisby &amp; Doctor Hobart both will again start in search of our Train. Found it and our
      Little Quartermaster &amp; Sergeant in fine health &amp; spirits. He had a letter for me from
      wife dated Sept 8th to 10th &amp; was on the verge of writing to her that I and Stuart were
      prisoners.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Now the gauntlet is run and our story told
      until we can get back to the regiment and learn the particulars. 30th - All well staid in camp
      with Bill, Stuart out gathering chestnuts. Afternoon went back to Regt. [Here perhaps it is
      well to remark, the Regt. is in the city of Chattanooga within a mile of where Stuart &amp; I
      came to the hilltop, and the Wagon train are some three miles distant on the North side of the
      Tennessee River, for greater safety &amp; comfort.] Found our Regt in a deplorable condition,
      many of the men entirely missing, among them John M. Baker of Browning, Joseph M. Derrickson,
      Absalom R. Lawless, James Hagle &amp; Jeremiah E Bailey of Rushville &amp; vicinity. Jasper
      Hooker (son of the old man north of town) badly wounded. Little Cunningham is safe and sound,
      I will now again refer to the &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
      Battlefield&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The rebs have just refused a Flag of truce
      sent out to bury our dead who lie rotting on the field, or to let us bring away our wounded
      who still lie where they fell. Such Hellish brutality is seldom witnessed, Oct 3rd Another is
      more successful, and several hundred wounded men have come in, but the dead are still
      unburied.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Oct. 3 Afternoon we are ordered to pack up and skedaddle at our utmost speed as the
      rebels had gotten across the river and captured several of our supply wagons and several of
      the teamsters. We obey and move back to the river bottom under the guns of the Chattanooga
      forts. Stuart had just made up a little rig to make some rings, xc, and only worked about an
      hour on a breast pin for Col. Davidson when we had to tear up and quit. This is the way it
      goes in war times. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sept. 4 [He's written Sept but the
      sequence of dates in the letter indicate October] I will now tell you something about how we
      get along &amp; how the city looks, xc. For the past two nights Each of us slept where and as
      he best could, Stuart and I slept on the ground on our oil blankets covered with woolen
      blankets, boards, iron, chains, pots, skillets, muss pans, camp kettles, [illeg], knapsacks,
      some clothing, guns &amp; ammunition + many other things too tedious to mention. That is we
      slept under a Loaded Wagon. A big corral is a great place to sleep, with more than a thousand
      wags, six or more thousand mules, at least two thousand men and several hundred horses, mules
      bawling, horses neighing, chains rattling, wagons jerked by the restless animals, men cursing,
      xc. xc all in one grand concert, combine to form the pleasures of a carol. I will now say a
      few words about&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The City of
      Chattanooga&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; It lies on the south side of the Tennessee
      River, is a very poor looking place some few of its houses are good but the great majority are
      poor. It is a remarkably rough place cut up with sharp round hills and deep gullies, all these
      hills are now fortified so that it is deemed impossible to drive us out of it. How this may
      be, God only knows. The river is crossed by two pontoon bridges and a third is being built.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Stuart &amp; I are in the very best of health, blessed be
      God for His mercies toward us, and for His great deliverance from the dangers just passed
      through. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; As to coming home I do not think of trying to
      get away in the present great excitement, at least not till our Railroad communication is
      restored to safety. Tell our Noble little boys that I will send them some money as soon as it
      is safe to do so. Tell Miss Barber we will make a Breast Pin for her, and send it as soon as
      we get safely to work again, unless our stock is captured or destroyed. All is safe yet, we
      have lost nothing. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Now dearest Wife &amp; Children all of
      you, and any who may be interested in this journal, my best respects to all of you, your Riley
      M. Hoskinson.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; P.S. If G.W. Scripps desires it let him
      publish our Escape. But I want this document kept sacredly, I would not loose it for $ 50
      dolls, R.M. Hoskinson.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>The Nashville Union confirming the statement respecting fall of Knoxville,
      Chattanooga, Cumberland Gap and Morris Island. Blessed be God for such Glorious news.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; 14th&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Travelled nearly all night getting
      up the mountain. Finally camped a few hours, then up and away again till just at sundown we
      reached our old camp at the mountain side. Staid there overnight, Rec'd orders to be ready to
      march at 5 O'clock in the morning but did not move till about the middle of the afternoon of
      the 15th, where we were routed all of a sudden and ordered off on the instant. Some of the men
      had gone foraging, some were sleeping and I was issuing Provisions. So we all had snap
      judgments taken on us. In less than 20 minutes our Brigade were in line and ready for off. A
      moment more and away we go along the mountains in a North Easterly direction. Country rough
      and stony but seemingly pretty good soil, judging from the fine corn and other crops. And if
      they could live on water only, they need never die, for here it is in rich abundance, and of
      the purest and best. The mountains here form a circular valley like the letter "U" and we are
      in the circular bottom. Camped for the night I slept on three rails, rather a rough bed, at
      least I thought so. Perhaps I was not a good judge. Slept pretty well however till roused this
      morn of the 16th at 4 O'Clock to be ready for March, up &amp; ready, 3rd Brigade goes ahead of
      us up the mountain, which is now to be climbed as we are told right in the face of the enemy.
      The signal lights were working most of the night, from our mountain top to the
      other.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Perhaps I had better describe a Signal Corps. It is
      a company of men who use a Flag in daytime, made of white cloth, and a dark spot in the
      center. At night they use a lamp, fixed to a flag staff. These men climb to some high
      prominent mountain peak, and by means of certain motions made with the Flag or Light, which is
      read, and understood by the other parties who may stand several miles distant, as easily as
      they can read the signs of a telegraph. These are used very extensively, as from these
      mountain peaks, the position and movements of an enemy can be seen and noted to any desired
      point.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sun up, and we are still in camp. Perhaps as a rear
      guard and to assist in case of necessity in getting our cannons and ammunitions up the
      Mountain. About Eight O'clock we are ordered into line and away for the scene of active strife
      that is climbing the Mountain. I was correct in my judgement about our delay. We were ordered
      to assist in getting the wagons up the mountain, whose sides are steepest of any yet seen. But
      slowly and toilsomely up, up the Poor Mules drag the huge Army wagons and Artillery, sometimes
      not more than six to ten feet at a time. The Mountain's perpendicular height is not more than
      1,000 feet, yet it took Eight hours of the hardest of work to get our Division teams up on the
      top. The scene was nothing but rugged rough wilds of mountains as far as the eye could reach,
      Rocks piled on rocks till they seemed to tower to the very Heavens. Finally the top is reached
      in safety. Rather level, but poor and rocky, several families eking out a miserable existence
      here for the past 16 to 20 years.</Transcript>

    <Transcript> Somebody stole Stuart's quart cup that we made our coffee in. I went to one of
      these houses and bought another and as much good sweet milk as I could drink for a quarter of
      a dollar. The woman wanted to give me the cup, saying she wanted to do all she could for the
      soldiers but I thought they looked too needy and would not take it. Thus, she said she was the
      mother of eleven children, all born on this miserable hill top. I told her of the beauties of
      Illinois compared with this rocky region and how much more they could raise with the same
      labor, etc. etc. She said they would try and get north as soon as quiet was restored to the
      country. Her husband is used by our men as a guide. Heaven bless them.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Up and away across the Mountain to its eastern side. Here
      it is almost perpendicular, topped with a margin of rock. Here we stopped and gazed upon the
      handsomest scene yet presented since in the service. Farm after Farm rose upon the view till
      lost in the long [?] distance, and shut out by a small mountain called "Pigeon Mountain." From
      this onward (we are told) commences the great cotton growing region of the state and just
      beyond this mountain and nearly straight East of us, the Rebs, are entrenched waiting for our
      approach. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Down we go very steep but quite smoother, large
      numbers of Pioneers making us a good road. Bottom reached, soil excellent in some places but
      very poor in others. Camped near an immense spring, drew &amp; issued beef to the men. Cook
      and ate some supper, pulled some Ragweeds and made a bed of them, used our canteens and boots
      for a pillow, covered with our oil blanket, slept soundly and sweetly, under the calm blue
      Heavens till morning. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sept. 17. Still all well here.
      Negley's Division gone before us towards the enemy. Gen. Thomas Army Corps are also gone in
      front of us and we (for the first time since in the service) left in the rear. Just at
      sunrise, boom goes a cannon, its fearful sound reverberating from mountain to mountain. Our
      men raise one long loud shout of joy. Soon several more followed in quick succession, then all
      silence for over an hour. Orders were then received for our men to put 40 rounds of ammunition
      in their cartridge boxes and 20 more in their pockets and be ready to move at a moment's
      warning as the enemy were evidently massing directly in front of us, and on our left several
      miles distant. Now nine o'clock, all is quiet suspense. Just at noon, ordered to march on the
      instant. Out we go, march to an open space, some half mile distant, full of little hills. Here
      men and artillery were halted in one seemingly inextricable mass. Gens McCook &amp; Sheridan
      presided and in a few moments the mass began to unfold itself and order was soon restored by
      each party marching to their several destinations so that in a few moments a Battery stood
      here, another there. The men were placed in little bands of not more than a Regiment in a
      place, some in the woods, others supporting the Batteries, etc. etc. In less than a quarter of
      an hour but very few men could be seen where only a few moments before all was seeming
      confusion. Now again came the stillness of Death as each one momentarily expected to hear the
      thunder of the opening contest. But it came not only from the distance some five miles in
      front and still nearer the sharp crack of musquetry, as the skirmishes would fire at each
      other. Here all remained quiet till about one o'clock at night. Where we were roused to draw
      and issue</Transcript>

    <Transcript>two days rations. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Morn of the
      18th&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Quite an important change of front takes place. The 8th Brigade is sent
      to the NE while we of the second remain in peace as before. Several cannon shots have been
      heard to the NE of us but all is still quiet here as late as eight o'clock. Weather dark &amp;
      cloudy, quite cool. 9 o'clock, ordered to march, up and away in a south easterly direction. We
      are told we are to go into camp to rest and wash our clothes, etc. The country we are passing
      over is remarkably poor, scarcely any soil at all. Little broken pieces of limestone and small
      flint gravel, with some little sand and clay mixed constitutes the most of the surface of this
      region. The timber is mostly of scrubby beach oak mixed among pines. 3 o'clock afternoon went
      into camp near a fine spring of water – on a pretty good farm – made ourselves as comfortable
      as possible supposing we were to remain here for some time. Where about seven o'clock in the
      evening we were again ordered to march. This went very much against the grain but must be
      obeyed so we packed up our little budgets and sat down to wait for marching orders. Here we
      sat till tired out, where most of us laid down round a fire made of secesh rails taken from
      the ground where only two days since rebeldom reigned supreme and where the little fights
      before referred to had taken place. Several men were killed and wounded on both sides. Not
      till half past Eleven o'Clock at night did the (now wished for) marching orders come. Then the
      men got to work and piled the rails they had collected on the several fires, and had a
      beautiful illumination at secesh expense. Started out, went a few rods and again stopped, wind
      high and chilly. Which made fire quite an object. So our men again collected rails and piles
      them on fires already kindled or kindled others till the whole Heavens were illuminated with
      the conflagration of secesh fencing. Started on, and at some little distance from the road, a
      Brigade ahead of us had fired a large log house which was burning furiously as we passed.
      Slowly and wearily on we go, start and stop, start, stop, stop and start, sometimes only four
      or five steps at a time. A regular funeral march, quite dark and entirely strange road. The
      men invented all sorts of funny jokes, xc xc to keep up their spirits. For some time we could
      not discover the North Star, in consequence of the smoke and dust, at last I observed if I
      could only see the Dipper, I could from it tell our course. One of the men remarked "They have
      thrown away the Dipper and substituted a Gourd, and turned the North Star over to the Southern
      Confederacy." This caused us a fine laugh, many such little jokes were played off during this
      tedious march. Till at last about 3 O'Clock of Saturday morning Sept. 19, we turned into camp,
      15 miles south of Chattanooga in the valley of the Chickamauga, Georgia. I was too tired to
      hunt wood or make a fire so I tumbled myself down in some brush covered with my oil blanket
      and fell asleep for the balance of the night, although it was cold &amp; frosty, was only
      awakened by our bugle calling for us to up and away. Ate a hasty breakfast and just as we
      expected to roll out, orders came that ours and the 1st Brigade would stay in camp till about
      Noon. While I sit penciling these lines the constant roar of cannon &amp; musquetry are
      distinctly heard in our front only a few miles distant. We expect our turn will soon come to
      join the deadly fray, as we are told, the Rebels are in great force just a little in front of
      us. About 10 O'Clock we slowly move forward, About X O'Clock in the afternoon we come to the
      battleground of the morning and still the sound is far to the front.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>We halt at what is called Crawfish Spring, 13 miles South East of Chattanooga. This
      is a spring in the full sense of the word. Nearly on the top of a hill flowing out from under
      some rocks. It’s bottom of white slate and white pebbles gives it the appearance of being
      clear as air. It’s volume is sufficient to run an ironworks or mill of almost any desired
      power. You can form some idea of its vastness when I tell you it is about the size of Tubmill
      Creek at Covodesville, Penna., at an ordinary stage of water, and its waters are good as they
      are pure. It far exceeds any spring yet seen. Here we halted a few moments &amp; ate some
      dinner, that is raw “Sowbelly” bread and water. Were then ordered into line and marched about
      a mile north on the Chattanooga Road, here lines of battle are formed in a skirt of woods. But
      soon Gen. Sheridan rode up and ordered our Brigade to go double quick to Lee &amp; Gordon’s
      Mill about a Mile East, to hold a ford of some importance. I and Stuart were ordered back to
      the Field Hospital at the spring to assist the surgeons. By the time we got back we had no
      lack of work, for by this time the wounded were coming in by scores, wounded in all parts of
      their bodies from the top of the head to ends of the toes. There were not less than fifty
      wounded in the feet &amp; ankles, and at least twice as many wounded in the hands &amp;* arms,
      several shot in the mouth, one right through [erased text] into the groin. One had his right
      leg shot off just below the knee and so on to the end of this fearful chapter. Stuart and I
      helped to carry them from the ambulances to places of safety, then made fires to help keep
      them warm as the Houses were now all full. We made fires in the yard, in the Garden, and in
      the woods outside the premises. In short, every where we could find a place to put a man for
      comfort. While some carried wounded, some made fires, others made &amp; distributed coffee to
      the poor chilled fellows, others temporarily bound up wounds xc, so all had their hands full
      to the letter. The conflict lasted till near 9 o’clock at night. I shall not attempt its
      description. I am not equal to the task. Language can’t do it. Sabbath Morn of the 20th Still
      all in line of battle, just sunrise the work of death begins again. Stuart &amp; I knowing our
      Brigade &amp; Regiment to be out of Provisions start in search of them. Found them on the
      Chattanooga road about three miles distant lying on a hillside in a small orchard, in line of
      battle. Although none of them as yet had been called into action, the 3rd Brigade of our
      Division was in the fight of yesterday and badly cut up. Some Rebel Prisoners told us this
      morning they intend to give us the severest fight yet given as they have come prepared to meet
      115,000 men. How much of this is truth remains to be seen. We of course know not. 9 o’clock
      and still the battle lays in front of us but our men not yet called. At 10 O’ Clock the
      cannonade becomes terrific in the Extreme, mixed with the incessant crash of musquetry. The
      work of death goes fearfully on. Our Brigade still not called, some few of them have lain down
      to sleep, some are writing letters to loved ones at home while scores of others are buying
      &amp; reading the daily Newspapers and a general calm &amp; seriousness pervades the rank
      &amp; file. Just at half past ten O’clock orders come for our Brigade to rush to the combat,
      away they go on double quick down the hill and into the woods, out of sight, which is the
      last</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I saw of the Regiment, or ever will of many of them, "till Heaven's last thunder
      shakes the world below." Mine &amp; Stuart's place was to stay on the point of the hill above
      the road and overlooking the contest till needed to assist the surgeons. In a few moments more
      the combat deepened into (if possible) tenfold terrific proportions. Thus it raged and thus we
      stood about 10 steps behind of our batteries till about half past one o'clock. The cannon
      shots were so rapid as to be (most of the time) too frequent to count, and the musquetry
      resembled the crackling of a handful of salt thrown into the fire, add to this the constant
      screaming of officers and men, various bayonette charges. Men marching at doublequick in all
      directions trying to get better positions. Cannons &amp; caissons being hauled at full gallop
      in every conceivable direction, couriers going at the topmost speed of their best horses. Then
      add the fearful wounds, bruises, cuts, slashes, groans &amp; cries, bloodshed &amp; death in
      all its forms, then imagine as much more as you can and then you will fall far short of a
      description of this Awful contest. I forgot to be afraid, and became so vengeful as to pray
      God that the whole southern Confederacy might be annihilated, for causing so much needless
      suffering and death. Our doctors never made their appearance so we of course stood idle
      spectators, at last up came a poor fellow that had been struck on his left thigh by a piece of
      shell, and about half size of my hand of flesh entirely carried away. I took his handkerchief
      and bound it up to staunch the blood, in a few moments more many wounded passed by us and one
      a tall handsome young man, the blood streaming from his mouth, Stuart asked him if he were
      wounded in the mouth, he simply pointed to his left side, where his clothes were all tattered
      by a stroke from a piece of shell. About this time I noticed our men were falling back out of
      the woods and we were about being surrounded, so Stuart &amp; I went still higher up the hill,
      but here also we were chased, and we then went back into a pine woods behind us and sat down
      to eat a bite and rest. While thus engaged two big shells came over us singing Boo-o-o-o-o-o,
      as they went, another shot cut off a limb from a tree close in front of us. 3 o'clock
      afternoon the storm of battle has somewhat abated, and Stuart &amp; I now start forward to
      hunt for our Regiment. Got on some half way, and were met by an officer who yelled to us not
      to dare go on the battlefield as our men had fallen back toward Chattanooga and the rebels had
      full possession of the field. We went on however, till in sight of where we first stood, when
      bang went a rifle and a ball whizzed close past our heads. We now began to think some little
      about personal safety, and turned in the direction the Officer had told us to go. We had only
      gotten about half a mile till we came to a small log house where our wounded had been carried
      till the floor was literally covered with bleeding, dying men. It looked much like a slaughter
      house, and the two women who lived there scared almost to death, so much so as to be of no use
      at all. Just at this moment three of our ambulances came along, so Stuart and I helped load
      them with wounded, &amp; concluded to go back to the Hospital and help take care of them and
      hunt the Regiment in the morning.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>As we went to the Hospital, we noticed in some woods at about a quarter of a mile
      distant from the road, several Secesh cavalry skulking in the timber. As soon as we came
      opposite them they would step out and shoot, then dodge back and hide, then come out and shoot
      again, this was repeated several times, as much as twenty or more, when a cavalry man of our
      own galloped up to us and said "don't you know these fellows are shooting at you: Get out of
      the way, as rapidly as you can." I replied, if they are shooting at us I would not be afraid
      to bare my breast and let them shoot at it all the afternoon if they could do no better than
      they had been doing. Just at that moment some of them who had a long ranged gun, let slip and
      the ball said, "sleo, o,o,o" as it passed in a few feet of my head. We now went a little
      faster, and were soon out of their range. [Pencil markings and corrections made later by
      Hoskinson begin to appear in the following passages of the letter.] Reached the Hospital in
      safety but had only time to unload our wounded when the whole premises, six Hospitals in
      number, were surrounded by two Brigades of Wheeler's Cavalry and a Regiment of Infantry,
      yelling at the top of their voices as if Hell had suddenly erupted itself of all its contents.
      In a few moments, seeing we made no resistance, a tall fine-looking Texan rode up and told us
      we were all&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Prisoners of
      War.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; This important Event took place around half past four
      O'clock Sabbath evening, Sept. 20th 1863. As we were perfectly powerless for resistance, we
      made the best we could of a bad bargain. The men now came up in squads and demanded our gun
      blankets, canteens, knives, guns, xc., xc. I dropped my pocket book, knife and Gold pen into
      my bootleg and hid my gun blanket &amp; canteen while they were occupied with the others.
      Stuart was stubborn and would not mind me to hide his blanket &amp; canteen, so he lost them
      both. This was fun for me because he was sulky and would not mind me. After a little while one
      of the men died, leaving an excellent blanket &amp; canteen so I got the blanket, washed the
      blood out of it and gave it to Stuart. There was no wrong in this as all of them would be
      taken away by the secesh. After awhile he got another canteen in the same way. When they came
      to me and wanted my knife, I offered them a case knife I had found in the road coming from the
      battlefield. Then supposing it was all I had, afterward let me alone. The officers did not
      mistreat us in any way but were very nice &amp; polite; but whenever they went away the
      scalawags would come and pick the men of all the little comforts they could. The Officers
      asked us many questions, and we asked as many in return. They took away some of our Hospital
      stores, all our Ambulances, Doctor's Horses, All our fine Band of Musical Instruments, that
      cost us $600 in [illeg] and all the guns they could find. The men had hid away several fine
      Enfield Rifles, and after the others were taken away, I advised them to break them so they
      could not be any use to the Secesh. They did so. General Wheeler on Tuesday sent in his
      medical director who allowed us one man to cook for 20 and 4 more to wait on them. This was
      very liberal.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>I will now leave off a regular narration and treat of variety. The first duties
      assigned to me were to go around and take the names of all the wounded, their Co., Rank &amp;
      Regiment. I found we had 146 then living, beside 19 that were so badly wounded as to die soon
      after coming in. One of these is shot through the Gullet, so that when he tries to drink, it
      runs out at the wound, another shot in the right eye and out at the ear. Two others shot
      through the hip and out through the Privates. Two others directly through the right Leg and
      yet able to walk unsupported. Many of the balance have fearful wounds in their thighs, and
      different parts of their bodies that will more than likely cause their death. Where separation
      takes place, 9 of these have died since [?] the above. Strange as it may seem to you, I can
      now stand and hold one of a man's legs while the other is cut off and not feel the least
      particle of that faintish disposition that troubled me so much in former life. Helping the
      Doctors cut off limbs and bind up wounds is now my daily
      duty.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sept. 22nd, Still occupied as before stated. We have
      almost hourly visits from our captors, yet none of us have been taken away or parolled. How
      soon we shall be no one can tell. I suffer considerable at night from severe cold, as I have
      to live out in the open air and only a gun blanket to cover me. It has frosted the past four
      nights till all the cotton plants are killed and most of the Tobacco. Stuart does not seem to
      mind the cold as much as I do. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sept. 23rd Calm, cold
      morning. Two more men died last night, some of the men are digging one vast grave for all at
      once, as we have not to date had time to bury any of them. We stored them in the cellar till
      we had our room almost covered. While I write a long cherished leg, belonging to a Capt.
      McIntire of the 51st, Ill. Now lies before me a catch for the flies as we cut it off
      yesterday. So it goes. It is much more easy to kill than make alive. Stuart &amp; several
      others were sent with a Flag of truce over to the battle ground, and found not only all our
      dead (at least 500) unburied and near 100 more variously wounded but still living, lying right
      where they fell. They collected them together in little groups, gave them bread &amp; water -
      all we could raise at this time, for our provisions were all out and those of us at the
      Hospital had to live on boiled wheat. There they had to leave them, as we had no means to get
      them away, but sent on Thursday morning, 24th, a detail to dress their wounds and do for them
      all they could. I will now try and describe some little of the
      sufferings.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Sufferings of a
      Hospital&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; The sound is very much like that of a lively
      revival meeting, where many pray in a low tone at the same time, mixed with loud exclamations,
      such as "O Lord" "O My God," "Lord Save," "Lord Help," "Lord Have Mercy", xc. Xc. Commingled
      with incoherent cries &amp; groans. This is our doleful music, day and night, with the
      addition of the wants; such as "I want up," "I want down," "I want a drink," "I want the pot,"
      "I want some medicine," "I want my wound dressed," "My wound is too tight," "Mine is too
      loose," "I am too hot," "I am too cold," "Doctor, how long can I live?" "How long must I lie
      thus?" "How long will it take to get well? "xc, xc, xc, xc. Then stretch imagination to its
      utmost and can form some faint idea of the reality.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>Sept. 24th. Nothing special, only General Wheeler sent Capt. Reisz, his chief of
      staff, to parole as many as he thought were necessary to be left as Hospital attendants. I was
      requested to assist him write them, which I did. He is a shrewd, keen looking young man &amp;
      very polite. I wrote the first one for myself, the second for Stuart, then several for others.
      When the men were called to sign them, he took Stuart's and had it signed by another man, so
      it was spoiled. By this time I had discovered a mistake in mine so tore it up and commenced
      another, and completely spoiled it, so by this time the blanks were all filled, and Stuart and
      I left out. He would not suffer any more written so I thought the matter over carefully, and
      came to this conclusion: It is the Will of God that you escape and you ought to do it. I told
      Stuart, but he would not hear to it, he said we would be recaptured, and then treated much
      worse in consequence. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; This afternoon I was sent with a
      squad of men, to Lee &amp; Gordon's Mill to remove a lot of rubbish from its head race. While
      performing this duty, two Brigades of Rebel Cavalry rode up to water their horses, and rest
      awhile. These would gather around us and ask questions of us. Most of them treated us quite
      respectable while others were very insulting, would come up close and peer into our eyes and
      ask, "What do you think of us now? Ha? Guess we whipped you good, didn’t we? Ha? Guess we made
      you run this time, didn’t we? Ha? You came to subjugate the South did you, ha? You came to
      free our Niggers did you? Ha? Guess old Rosa couldn't make Longstreet run," xc. xc. Much of
      the talk too profane and indecent to write. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; 25th Noon,
      Stuart and I sent back to the mill to finish repairs and get some wheat ground, found first
      one thing, then another out of order. These we righted piece by piece and finally got the
      thing to run, which proved to be a pretty good mill. While putting it in repair we were again
      insulted as before, with such expressions as, you folks broke up this mill, and now you want
      to grind on it, Damn you, don't you think you deserve to be starved to death? Why did you not
      put a coal in it, as you have done in all of the others? Xc, xc. We got our wheat ground, but
      not bolted as the bolt was cut to pieces, and started to our Hospital Prison. One the way back
      I again spoke to Stuart about running away from the infernal set. He still objected. In the
      afternoon I built a brick oven for the men to bake some bread. This afternoon, the secesh
      brought some meat, flour, bacon, a little rice &amp; salt, to last us two days, and took from
      one of the other Hospitals as many slightly wounded men as could be hauled in the two wagons,
      and said they intended the next day to march off all that could walk and remove all the men
      not Paroled, to Atlanta, Georgia. I now went to the Pine Woods, knelt down and asked God to
      instruct me how to act in the case. I came to the conclusion it were best, to Escape as my
      conscience was clear in the matter.</Transcript>

      Sanford that I could be forced to sue for permission to enter my own house and that such an
      outrage as its military occupation to the exclusion of me and my children could ever have been
      perpetrated by anyone in the whole extent of this country. I had been warned by an anxious
      friend that such a design was in contemplation nearly a month ago &amp; advised to remove to a
      place of safety all my property that was of any value. Still incredulous I complied with his
      earnest entreaties in regard to the Mt. Vernon relics, plate, &amp; pictures that we could
      never replace and after a visit of about 10 days to a friend in Fairfax was
      preparing</Transcript>

      reception of my younger children who will soon be returning from their different schools when
      I was informed that the whole place as well as the mansion was occupied by Northern troops. I
      intended to have obtained a permit and have returned to make some further arrangements for the
      comfort of my servants many of them old and infirm but was told by a gentleman who had made
      the same attempt that none could be given. So I am left homeless not even able to get or send

      fortifying the Arlington Heights. However, I forget that I am a suppliant and cannot trust my

      sympathize perhaps even with the wife of a "Traitor" and a rebel. I implore you by the
      courtesy due to any woman and which no brave soldier could deny, to allow my old coachman by
      whom I send this letter to get his clothes and give some letters to my manager relative to the
      farm and to give my market man a pass that will enable him to go and return from Washington as
      usual where his family resides. My gardner Ephraim also has a wife in Washington and is

      allow the servants to go on with their usual occupations unmolested by the soldiers and
      protected by your authority, also to allow my boy Billy whom I only left at home to complete
      some work in the garden to come to me with his clothes as I can not use my carriage without
      his aid, and to permit my maid Marcellina to send me some (other? more?) articles Chat I did
      not bring away. She and the woman in the yard Selina can get what I want out of the house. I
      will not trouble you with any further requests only I pray that God may ever spare you and
      yours the agony and inconvenience I am now enduring.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;

      no unease regards to any information that might be communicated through my servants as our
      mails are so delayed that no letters from anywhere since the occupation of Alexandria have I
      received. Any letters or papers brought by the market man from Washington will you please to
      (sic) forward them. Since writing the above my Coachman informs me is so unwell he is anxious

      Dear Anna, &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; This is wrote in the sound of a severe attack
      which is going on within three miles of us. We were attached this morning and several of our
      Regiments badly cut up. I do not yet know what may be the result, but from the persistency of
      the attack, there must be heavy loss on both sides. There is a great many Wounded brought in
      already but I think we will be able to hold our own. Buck [?] will be here in a few hours,
      with his Advance Guard of 25,000 men, the boats are ordered to hold themselves in readiness to
      bring him over the river. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; If he reaches here in time I
      have no doubt but we will inflict serious loss on the enemy, but if on the contrairey [sic] he
      does not reach here in time we may suffer a serious Disaster, at any rate we will not make as
      good use of our victory as we would if he was here.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; April
      7th, 8 P.M. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Dear Anna, I now sit down to finish what I began yesterday,
      having passed through 36 hours of the most Intense anxitey [sic] that I ever [?], it was an
      age to me. We were attacted in our Incampments by the Forces under Bueregard [Beauregard], it
      was a complete surprise and resulted in a complete Route of our Advance Guard, which were
      driven in over 3 Miles, the Enemy Killing</Transcript>

    <Transcript>and taking Prisoners at Every step, at last we got them stopped about 3 P.M., and
      from that, to dark we held our own at 4. Gen. Buel's men appeared on the Opposite side of the
      River, and the Steamers commenced bringing them over as fast, as possible, it was a Reprieve
      to us for our men were getting completly [sic] demoralized and many of our Officers were
      showing the White Feather but the arrival of Buel's Men infused new life into them. At about 7
      p.m. the firing ceased for the night except the Gun Boats, which kept throwing Shell, about
      every 10 minutes, through the night, into their lines, doing a great deal of harm to them. By
      dark we were full of Wounded men, and every other boat was also. This morning we were ordered
      down to Savannah to put off our Wounded. Before we left, the Battle had began again, but this
      time we were prepared for them and made [?] everywhere, and by 12 o'clock, we had recovered
      all the ground we had lost yesterday and also taken all the artillery back that we had lost
      yesterday, and also recovered some of our men, who were taken, at the same time, taking many
      of the enemy Prisoners. Also at 2 p.m. it was no longer a Retreat but a Rout on their part and
      even now our Cavalry are harassing their retreat, and sending in Prisoners, in small squads.
      The prisoners say that they made the attack with 50,000 men and 50,000 more arrived by 12
      o'clock, making in all full 100,000 Able Men but the timely arrival of Buel gave new
      spirit</Transcript>

    <Transcript>to our Men although some of them proved themselves the Basest Kind of Cowards,
      Retreating for Protection to the Boats, and endeavouring to get on Board and were only kept
      off by the Bayonet. Indeed 5 of them attempted to swim the River. 3 of them were drowned, in
      the attempt. I saw them drown. And I assure you they were the first Men I ever saw drown that
      I was willing to stand and look on without trying to render them assistance. If they had been
      my own Relations I should have been glad that their Infamy was hid in that way. Their fate
      deterred others and the Arrival of the Reinforcements encouraged the others, many of whom
      became Ashamed of their Cowardice, fell into the Ranks of the advancing troops, as the left
      the Boats and Nobly redeemed their honor. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; When the first
      Boat arrived we had near 5000 Men, perfectly [?] Panic Struck and by the time the last was
      over one half or more were gone.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; But I cannot give you any
      description of the Battle other than it was a continual Road of Cannon and Musquetry,
      sometimes on our right sometimes on our Center again on our Left and sometimes from all three
      directions. My duties kept me at the Boat, all the time on I could not have helped going up
      and lending my aid as far as Possible. I did go on Shore and Entreat the Cowards to act like
      Men but it was no use. I might as well</Transcript>

    <Transcript>talked to Stone Men. They were perfectly stolide [?] at last, I began to Curse them.
      I took out a piice [sic] of Paper and Asking one of them his name and Regiment, I put it down
      telling him I would publish the names of every Coward I could find. This had some Effect for
      they kept shy of me. I then told them to come on Board as there were some Petticoats on Board
      that they could exchange for their Pantaloons, which they disgraced. Next, I tried their Fears
      as I found Shame had no Effect, and I do believe If I had not been stopped I would have shot
      some of them and I am very sure I never would have regretted it. Every time we fought over a
      Regiment the landing was covered with Wounded, which was taken on Board as fast as Possible
      and soon every Room on the Boat and every foot of floor was covered with Brave Men. Every one
      of whom I loved like a Brother, after dark, we ceased to Ferry and I then went down in the
      Cabin to help the Wounded, we had 3 doctors and three nurses, all of whom did their duty,
      particularly the Nurses, bathing the Wounds aiding the Surgeons, to dress them and giving them
      Water, Before 12 o'Clock the Linen for Bandages gave out, and then the Sheets and Pillow Slips
      followed, and at day Break there was no more. The Officers of the Boat then offered their
      trunks and Shirts and Drawers, went the same way three shirts and two pair of drawers of mine
      going but if they had been gold and would have done good they must have gone.
      &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; [End of letter written around the edge of Page
      1]&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; Oh how I would love to have the hanging of the traitors
      that brought this on. If I ever hated any one it is those that I think caused it and their
      Cowardly friends the Traitor and the Sympathizers who without the Courage to make Treachery
      respectable will do all they can to lead good Men into it by their Lying and Devilish
      Soppystry [soppistry?] seem to me worse than [illeg.]. I will write to you tomorrow after I
      get a sleep as I am now pretty well tired not having slept for 60 hours but I could not sleep
      until I had wrote to you to assure you of my love. Yours for ever, Charles.</Transcript>

      own feelings this afternoon, I should prefer anything else to letter-writing. Yes; I would
      even prefer a personal interview with you, while you are enjoying the satisfaction of being
      mistriss [sic] of the house you are occupying. I have put in this day so far in a military
      style. First a morning report. Second, inspection of my Co. Third, going to church. Fourth,
      dinner. Fifth, smoking. Sixth, Letter-writing. Besides washing, shaving, boot-blacking,
      &amp;c., which should have come under the head of firstly, and consequently must be left
      out.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;May is almost gone, but still I am owned and used by Uncle Sam, and
      consequently cannot say as yet, what I shall eat, drink,</Transcript>

      coming, when I shall once more own a right in myself in fee simple, except your legal share,
      which will probably be at least one third, unless you have been ammending [sic] the Statute,
      during my absence, so as to claim one half. But we shall not dispute about the title, nor the
      share. The only thing that perplexes me now is the slow pace at which Old Time moves along. If
      I could only go asleep some night, and wake up and find myself steaming up the Miss. at about
      twelve miles per hour, I should feel much happier than I now am; clouded with uncertainty. At
      no time since I have been in the service have I fealt [sic] as I do now. You can imagine how
      one feels who has overstaid [sic] their time on a visit and is anxious to get home.

      needed no more in the field, and I cannot conceive what our Government is keeping such an army
      for, as each day is attended with an enormous expense. There are Veterans enough, with the
      Negroe [sic] troops and the regular army, to maintain the honor of the Government anywhere in
      the South, and especially as they are as anxious for peace as we.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;But
      everything moves so slow about the military car, that I have long since become
      disgusted.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Our mail facilities are much improved here now. We get our mail
      direct from Mobile every day. Last night I received your letter of the 14th inst. This is the

    <Transcript>containing two letters from Ellen and one from Levi, for which I will promise to pay
      in kisses, when we return to the Union.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Well, there it is. I thought it would
      come sometime. News has just come in that Kerby [sic] Smith has surrendered all his forces
      unconditionally. And Gen. Canby has issued orders for all troops whose term of service expires
      before the 1st of October next to report their strength condition &amp;c., that they may
      proceed to their respective States to be mustered out, and that discreptive [sic] Rolls be
      sent to all who are in the Hospitals that they may be mustered out where they are. Joy has
      once more broke loose in our camp, as this is repeated from mouth to mouth. Hats go up as well
      as shouts in all directions. And one thing more. What! More yet? After all this good news?
      Yes; There is one man we all want to see very much, and that is the Paymaster. All are out of
      Greenbacks, and have been out for some time. And if we are not paid before starting for home,
      I do not know what we shall do during our journey.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(See next Sheet for

      will see by the papers the account of the terrible explosion in Mobile. At least one fifth of
      the whole City is in ruins. The explosion was distinctly heard at this place, a distance of
      140 miles.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;To think of the effects of the explosion of 30 tons of powder
      confined in a ware house is terrible, and beyond the comprehension of even those most familiar
      with its power. Many were killed and maimed at the distance of a mile from where the powder
      was confined. Carriages were smashed to pieces at the same distance, and the sash and glass of
      the intire [sic] city broken. The number killed will never be known, as many were blown to
      fragments, and nearly all so mutalated [sic] that they could not be</Transcript>

    <Transcript>recognized. Up to yesterday morning, 300 bodies had been removed from the ruins, and
      they were still finding more. I was told by an Officer belonging to our Brigade, who was in
      the City at the time, that he saw several limbs and fragments of human bodies lying in the
      streets near the Battle House, which was 3/4 of a mile from the explosion. This is one more
      sad lesson to the careless and criminal authorities, who regardless of the life and property

    <Notes>This letter, from Captain William McMicken of the 10th Minnesota Infantry Volunteers to
      his wife Rowena Ostrander McMicken, describes his impatience towards his continuing military
      duties after the end of the Civil War. As McMicken writes the letter, news reaches the camp
      that General Edmund Kirby Smith has surrendered the last Confederate field army of any
      significant size, and McMicken hears that General Edward Canby is ordering preparations for
      many of the Union soldiers to return to their homes. McMicken also sends his wife news about
      the explosion of the gunpowder warehouse in Mobile on May 25th, relating details he's heard
      from eyewitnesses (though he himself has not been in Mobile since the event). McMicken
      concludes with some comments about the family, and gives his wife a brief description of a
      trip he took the previous day to a school in Marion Station, Mississippi.</Notes>
    <HistoricalNotes>On May 25, 1865, an ordnance depot in Mobile exploded, killing roughly 300
      people, and doing $730,000.00 in property damage. The explosions were followed by fires that
      consumed a large portion of the city. The cause of the explosion has never been determined:
      while some contemporaries suggested that it had been deliberate sabotage by former
      Confederates, negligence by workers at the depot is now considered the likeliest
      cause.</HistoricalNotes>

      Lincoln, has been captured and shot, in a barn in Maryland. Hope it is so. We are all very

    <Notes>This letter, from Rowena Ostrander McMicken to her husband, Captain William McMicken of
      the 10th Minnesota Infantry Volunteers, relates news about the war and life at home in Lake
      Mills, Wisconsin. She expresses her wish that he was home, and fills him in on news regarding
      the assassination of Lincoln and the death of John Wilkes Booth. She talks about the remaining
      Confederate resistance, and rumors about Jefferson Davis's whereabouts. She concludes with
      talk of life at home, and the growth of Wisconsin flora, and adds some brief comment on her
      uncertainty about what is taking place in Mobile, Alabama, where William is stationed.</Notes>

    <Transcript>Lake Mills, May 25th 65&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;My Dear
      William:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;I was very much in hopes of getting a letter from you tonight, but
      failed to do so. The only letter I have received for four weeks was the one written at
      Montgomery the 23r &amp; 30th of April. There is a report that the 16th A.C. were going to
      Texas, but I realy [sic] hope this is not true, for I should begin to think that you would
      never get home again.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;I see by the Mant[illegible] Express that Sec. Stanton
      has sent to Gov. Miller to know where is the best place in that state for troops to be sent
      to, to be paid and mustered out, so that looks some like getting out of the service soon,
      which I realy [sic] hope will be the case.</Transcript>

    <Transcript>You have probably ere this heard of the capture of Jeff Davis. What a coming out of
      the little end of the horn that was, to be found in his wife's petticoats, a fit winding up of
      the Confederate leaders. Hope they will take him around for a show. It is said that the cloths
      are to be sent to the Fair at Chicago next week. Barnum is very anxious to get hold of them. I
      believe they would pay the war debt if they would take him around just as he was dressed for a
      show. I should have thought he would have killed himself before he would have been taken. He
      is not as brave a man as we have thought him to be.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Good night my dear, with
      much love a a scan if [sic] kisses for you.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Rowena</Transcript>

    <Notes>This letter, from Rowena Ostrander McMicken to her husband, Captain William McMicken of
      the 10th Minnesota Infantry Volunteers, focuses on events in the aftermath of the war. She
      expresses her concerns that his deployment will continue after the war. Rowena also notes the
      departure of her parents westward for Blue Earth County, Minnesota, and comments on the
      hostilities between white settlers and Native Americans there. She tells William about the
      death of a man he served with in the West, and worries about how many of their friends have
      been killed. She concludes the letter with talk about the capture of Jefferson Davis, and what
      she thinks a fitting end would be for him.</Notes>

    <Notes>This letter, from Captain William McMicken of the 10th Minnesota Infantry Volunteers to
      his daughter Nellie, focuses primarily on the freed slaves that McMicken has come into contact
      with. After some comments about Nellie's life at home, William tells his daughter about the
      "contraband boy" (a freed slave) he is thinking of bringing home to work for him, and suggests
      that he will find a freed slave girl to assist his wife (Nellie's mother). He then talks more
      broadly about the many freed slaves who have followed his army north from Mississippi to
      Memphis, Tennessee.</Notes>

    <Title>Philip Van Buskirk diary as a Confederate infantryman and deserter during the Civil War,

    <Date>1863-1866</Date>
    <Dates>1863 1864 1865 1866</Dates>
    <Notes>This diary chronicles events from 1863 to the later part of 1865 during the American
      Civil War. Van Buskirk served as a Confederate infantryman and later deserted. An earlier
      volume detailing events from 1861 to 1862 was taken from him when he was captured by Union
      forces. Some attempts were made by him to reconstruct those years when he transcribed his
      smaller journals into this larger format in the 1890s. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;He
      enlisted in the 13th Virginia Infantry in June of 1861 and was stationed at Camp Walker near
      Manassas, Virginia. He deserted in 1862 and wrote in his diary that he had made an "escape
      from his regiment" most likely because he failed to gain a commission. Captured shortly
      thereafter by Union forces he was sent to Camp Chase military prison in Ohio. Released during
      a prisoner exchange later that year he wandered northward chronicling the everyday face of
      civilians caught in the warfare that surrounded them. In particular he documents the wartime
      activities and struggle for survival in the region of the upper Shenandoah Valley. Throughout
      this period he describes the conditions of the towns and countryside, his own attempts at
      employment and records the sentiments of the people he encounters. After the Civil War ended
      in 1865, Van Buskirk, despondent and often unemployed, returned to Washington D.C. to reenlist
      in the U.S. Marine Corps. In one of his last entries in his journal for 1865 he exclaims "1865
      is gone. My God! What memories crowd it! It has passed over me like an ugly dream".</Notes>
    <HistoricalNotes>Philip Clayton Van Buskirk, onetime drummer of marines, Confederate soldier,
      Mate in the United States Navy and sometime settler on the Snohomish River in Washington led
      an eventful life and throughout its years was an assiduous diarist. He began a detailed record
      of daily events in 1851 and continued to keep a diary, almost without interruption until
      shortly before his death in 1903. Van Buskirk was a drummer on Admiral Perry's expedition to
      open Japan to foreign trade. In addition to his comments on daily affairs he consistently
      prepared and maintained a variety of complex tables recording such diverse data as the
      weather, his duty status, the condition of his health as well as his moral tenor. He also
      maintained charts, various chronologies and drew maps and sketches.</HistoricalNotes>
