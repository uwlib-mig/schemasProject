               <p>Most recent version of EDTF available at https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/.</p>
               <p>Six formats are recommended for values in Date, each corresponding to a specific EDTF

                  the appropriate notation.
               </p>

               <p>For the xsd, datatype is xs:string; the datatype is more accurately http://id.loc.gov/datatypes/edtf,
                  which is not a valid QName and is inavlid according to schema-4-properties, but this
                  does not seem to be machine-actionable; more exploration needed.
               </p>
               <p>EDTF is still a standard in progress. It has not yet been accpted as a full recommendation.
                  It should be voted on in 2018 by ISO. We are anticipating it will becoming a 2-part
                  ISO 8601-2018.

               <p>Michael Honey was born in 1947 in Lansing, Michigan. He grew up in Williamston, Pontiac,
                  and Grand Rapids in Michigan, and Toledo, Ohio. His father was a World War II veteran
                  and urban planner–turned professor who was born into an English farming family in
                  Michigan. His mother came from a French-Canadian working-class family in Detroit.
                  This background had a profound influence on Dr. Honey’s views, his affinity for union
                  workers, and his later academic interests. Honey attended Oakland University, then
                  an experimental, humanities-centered college in southeast Michigan, from 1965 to 1969.
                  Amid the escalation of the Vietnam War, he received approval for his conscientious
                  objector status when he graduated.
               </p>
               <p>After college, he went to Kentucky and subsequently spent six years in Memphis to
                  serve as the Southern Director of the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation.
                  He completed his graduate degrees at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and at
                  Northern Illinois University, where he focused his research on labor history and developed
                  his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights. He has since authored several
                  other books, including Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther
                  King's Last Campaign.
               </p>
               <p>He came to University of Washington Tacoma in 1990 as a founding faculty member. Currently
                  holding the Fred and Dorothy Haley endowed professorship of Humanities, he teaches
                  African-American and labor history. During his time at UW Tacoma, he has also served
                  as the Harry Bridges Endowed Chair of Labor Studies.
