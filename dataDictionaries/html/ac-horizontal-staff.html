               <p>oseph H. Wohleb practiced independently in Olympia from 1911-1945. He joined his son
                  Robert in 1946 to form Wohleb and Wohleb. After the death of Joseph in 1958, Robert
                  carried on

               <p>This drawing shows a preliminary design of an observation tower and restaurant for
                  the
                  1962 Seattle World's Fair Exhibition. Set on the only section of the fair grounds
                  that was not
                  owned by the city, the site did not have the height restrictions of other exhibits/pavillions
                  at the fair. The lot, 37-by-37 m, was purchased by private investors for $75,000 and
                  is still
                  privately owned. Although there is much contention surrounding who came up with the
                  final
                  design of the Space Needle, John Graham is widely acknowledged as its architect.
