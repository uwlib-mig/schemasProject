               </p>
               <p>The Title is a concise sentence which will be used to label the thumbnails in CONTENTdm;
                  it will also be the first line of the descriptive information. The Title may be the
                  caption assigned by the photographer or the collector, or it may be created by Special
                  Collections staff from the given caption and from additional sources. In the absence
                  of any caption, the Title will be provided by Special Collections staff.
               </p>
               <p>If the caption provided by the photographer is adequate, place it in the Title field.
                  Then, the Notes field should include this phrase: Title taken from photograph.
               </p>
               <p>If the caption provided by the photographer is inadequate, a created title should
                  be placed in the Title field; the Notes field should then read: Caption on image:
                  "Image title."
               </p>
               <p>If there is a series caption, it should be added, in the Notes field, in sequence
                  after the title on the image: Caption on image: "Image title"; "Series title." There
                  should also be a separate notation in the Notes field in the form: Part of Hegg series
                  entitled: "Series title."

               <p>Most recent version of EDTF available at https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/.</p>
               <p>Six formats are recommended for values in Date, each corresponding to a specific EDTF
                  format:
               </p>

               <p>If the value of Date is YYYY?, enter YYYY?</p>

               <p>If the value of Date is [month], YYYY, enter YYYY-MM.</p>
               <p>If the value of Date is between YYYY and YYYY, enter YYYY/YYYY</p>
               <p>If the value of Date is between YYYY and YYYY?, enter YYYY?/YYYY?</p>
               <p>If the value of Date is not any of the above, consult the EDTF spedification to determine
                  the appropriate notation.
               </p>
               <p>Date-Edtf value should agree with dates values entered in Date and Dates fields.</p>

               <p>If Date field = "between 1930 and 1939" then Date EDTF = "1930/1939"</p>
               <p>If Date field = "between 1855 and 1999?" then Date EDTF = "1855?/1999?"</p>

               <p>This document needs a reference to the final spec.</p>
               <p>For the xsd, datatype is xs:string; the datatype is more accurately http://id.loc.gov/datatypes/edtf,
                  which is not a valid QName and is inavlid according to schema-4-properties, but this
                  does not seem to be machine-actionable; more exploration needed.
               </p>
               <p>EDTF is still a standard in progress. It has not yet been accpted as a full recommendation.
                  It should be voted on in 2018 by ISO. We are anticipating it will becoming a 2-part
                  ISO 8601-2018.
