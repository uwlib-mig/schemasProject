               <p>A brief descriptive phrase that includes these elements, generally in this order:
                  who, what, where, when.
               </p>
               <p>The Title is a concise sentence which will be used to label the thumbnails for the
                  compound objects in CONTENTdm; it will also be the first line of the descriptive information.
                  The Title may be a caption assigned by a photographer/creator/contributor or the collector,
                  or it may be created by Special Collections staff from the given caption and from
                  additional sources. In the absence of any caption, the Title will be provided by Special
                  Collections staff.
               </p>
               <p>If the caption provided by a photographer/creator/contributor is adequate, place it
                  in the Title field. Then, the Notes field should include a phrase like this: "Title
                  taken from photograph" or "Title taken from text attached to resource."
               </p>
               <p>If the caption provided by a photographer/creator/contributor is inadequate, a created
                  title should be placed in the Title field; the Notes field should then read something
                  like: 'Caption on image: "Image title" ' or 'Title provided by University of Washington
                  Libraries staff.'
               </p>
               <p>If there is a series caption, it should be added in the Notes field; the note should
                  begin "Series Title: "; the note should be in sequence after the notes describing
                  the title (for example, the 'Caption on image: "Image title" ' note). There should
                  also be a separate notation in the Notes field in the form: Part of Hegg series entitled:
                  "Series title."

               <p>Most recent version of EDTF available at https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/.</p>
               <p>Six formats are recommended for values in Date, each corresponding to a specific EDTF
                  format:
               </p>
               <p>If the value of Date is YYYY, enter YYYY.</p>
               <p>If the value of Date is YYYY, enter YYYY?</p>
               <p>If the value of Daye is [month] DD, YYYY, enter YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
               <p>If the value of Date is [month], YYYY, ebter YYYY-MM.</p>

               <p>If the value of Date is between YYYY and YYYY, enter YYYY?/YYYY?</p>
               <p>If the value of Date is not any of the above, consult the EDTF spedification to determine
                  the appropriate notation.
               </p>
               <p>Date-Edtf value should agree with dates values entered in Date and Dates fields.</p>

               <p>This document needs a reference to the final spec.</p>
               <p>For the xsd, datatype is xs:string; the datatype is more accurately http://id.loc.gov/datatypes/edtf,
                  which is not a valid QName and is inavlid according to schema-4-properties, but this
                  does not seem to be machine-actionable; more exploration needed.
               </p>
               <p>EDTF is still a standard in progress. It has not yet been accpted as a full recommendation.
                  It should be voted on in 2018 by ISO. We are anticipating it will becoming a 2-part
                  ISO 8601-2018.

               <p>This drawing refers to a series of blockades enacted by the British and the French
                  in 1806/1807.
               </p>
               <p>The British began in May 1806 by issuing Orders in Council that placed the entire
                  coast of Europe under a naval blockade. France retaliated with a series of decrees
                  collectively known as the Continental System. The Berlin Decrees (Nov 1806) prohibited
                  any vessel coming from Britain from landing at a port under French control. Britain's
                  naval supremacy, however, allowed her to force ships from neutral countries to stop
                  in Britain on their way to the continent, lessening the economic impact of the blockade.
                  Napoleon's Milan Decree (March 1807) authorized any ship coming from Britain to the
                  continent to be confiscated. Ultimately, the blockade hurt France more than it did
                  England, causing widespread food shortages and a general recession.

               <p>"Historical Notes" is distingushed from "Notes" mainly because it is more like "writing"
                  and creates a braod historical context. Values in the "Notes" field may be considered
                  more "indexable" insofar as they precisely descibe the image.

                  it will also be the first line of the descriptive information. The Title may be the
                  caption assigned by the photographer or the collector, or it may be created by Special
                  Collections staff from the given caption and from additional sources. In the absence
                  of any caption, the Title will be provided by Special Collections staff.

               <p>If the caption provided by the photographer is adequate, place it in the Title field.

               <p>If the value of Date is not any of the above, consult the EDTF spedification to determine
                  the appropriate notation.
               </p>

               <p>For the xsd, datatype is xs:string; the datatype is more accurately http://id.loc.gov/datatypes/edtf,
                  which is not a valid QName and is inavlid according to schema-4-properties, but this
                  does not seem to be machine-actionable; more exploration needed.
               </p>
               <p>EDTF is still a standard in progress. It has not yet been accpted as a full recommendation.
                  It should be voted on in 2018 by ISO. We are anticipating it will becoming a 2-part
                  ISO 8601-2018.

               <p>This drawing refers to a series of blockades enacted by the British and the French
                  in 1806/1807.
               </p>
               <p>The British began in May 1806 by issuing Orders in Council that placed the entire
                  coast of Europe under a naval blockade. France retaliated with a series of decrees
                  collectively known as the Continental System. The Berlin Decrees (Nov 1806) prohibited
                  any vessel coming from Britain from landing at a port under French control. Britain's
                  naval supremacy, however, allowed her to force ships from neutral countries to stop
                  in Britain on their way to the continent, lessening the economic impact of the blockade.
                  Napoleon's Milan Decree (March 1807) authorized any ship coming from Britain to the
                  continent to be confiscated. Ultimately, the blockade hurt France more than it did
                  England, causing widespread food shortages and a general recession.
